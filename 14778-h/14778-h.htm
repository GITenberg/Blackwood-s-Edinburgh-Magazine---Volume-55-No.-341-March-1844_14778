    <p>From the various circumstances of our day, the impression is
    powerfully made upon intelligent men in Europe, that some
    extraordinary change is about to take place in the general
    condition of mankind. A new ardour of human intercourse seems
    to be spreading through all nations. Europe has laid aside her
    perpetual wars, and seems to be assuming a <i>habit</i> of
    peace. Even France, hitherto the most belligerent of European
    nations, is evidently abandoning the passion for conqest, and
    begining to exert her fine powers in the cultivation of
    commerce. All the nations of Europe are either following her
    example, or sending out colonies of greater or less magnitude,
    to fill the wild portions of the world. Regions hitherto
    utterly neglected, and even scarcely known, are becoming
    objects of enlightened regard; and mankind, in every quarter,
    is approaching, with greater or less speed, to that combined
    interest and mutual intercourse, which are the first steps to
    the true possession of the globe.</p>

    <p>But, we say it with the gratification of Englishmen, proud
    of their country's fame, and still prouder of its
    principles&mdash;that the lead in this noblest of all human
    victories, has been clearly taken by England. It is she who
    pre-eminently stimulates the voyage, and plants the colony, and
    establishes the commerce, and civilizes the people. And all
    this has been done in a manner so little due to popular caprice
    or national ambition, to the mere will of a sovereign, or the
    popular thirst of possession, that it invests the whole process
    with a sense of unequaled security. Resembling the work of
    nature in the simplicity of its growth, it will probably also
    resemble the work of nature in the permanence of its existence.
    It is not an exotic, fixed in an unsuitable soil by capricions
    planting; but a seed self-sown, nurtured by the common air and
    dews, assimilated to the climate, and strikig its roots deep in
    the ground which it has thus, by its own instincts, chosen. The
    necessities of British commerce, the urgency of English
    protection, and the overflow of British population, have been
    the great acting causes of our national efforts; and as those
    are causes which regulate themselves, their results are as
    regular and unshaken, as they are natural and extensive. But
    England has also had a higher motive. She has unquestionably
    mingled a spirit of benevolence largely with her general
    exertions. She has laboured to communicate freedom, law, a
    feeling of property, and a consciousness of the moral debt due
    by man to the Great Disposer of all, wherever she has had the
    power in her hands. No people <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page270"
       name="page270"></a>[pg 270]</span> have ever been the worse
       for her, and all have been the better, in proportion to
       their following her example. Wherever she goes, oppression
       decays, the safety of person and property begins to be felt,
       the sword is sheathed, the pen and the ploughshare commence
       alike to reclaim the mental and the physical soil, and
       civilization comes, like the dawn, however slowly advancing,
       to prepare the heart of the barbarian for the burst of
       light, in the rising of Christianity upon his eyes.</p>

    <p>The formation of a new route between India and Europe by the
    Red Sea&mdash;a route, though well known to the ancient world,
    yet wholly incapable of adoption by any but an Arab horseman,
    from the perpetual tumults of the country&mdash;compelled
    England to look for a resting-place and depot for her
    steam-ships at the mouth of the Red Sea. Aden, a desolated
    port, was the spot fixed on; and the steam-vessels touching
    there were enabled to prepare themselves for the continuance of
    their voyage. We shall subsequently see how strikingly British
    protection has changed the desolateness of this corner of the
    Arab wilderness, how extensively it has become a place of
    commerce, and how effectually it will yet furnish the means of
    increasing our knowledge of the interior of the great Arabian
    peninsula.</p>

    <p>It is remarkable that Africa, one of the largest and most
    fertile portions of the globe, remains one of the least known.
    Furnishing materials of commerce which have been objects of
    universal desire since the deluge&mdash;gold, gems, ivory,
    fragrant gums, and spices&mdash;it has still remained almost
    untraversed by the European foot, except along its coast. It
    has been circumnavigated by the ships of every European nation,
    its slave-trade has divided its profits and its pollutions
    among the chief nations of the eastern and western worlds; and
    yet, to this hour, there are regions of Africa, probably
    amounting to half its bulk, and possessing kingdoms of the size
    of France and Spain, of which Europe has no more heard than of
    the kingdoms of the planet Jupiter. The extent of Africa is
    enormous:&mdash;5000 miles in length, 4600 in breadth, it forms
    nearly a square of 13,430,000 square miles! the chief part
    solid ground; for we know of no Mediterranean to break its
    continuity&mdash;no mighty reservoir for the waters of its
    hills&mdash;and scarcely more than the Niger and the Nile for
    the means of penetrating any large portion of this huge
    continent.</p>

    <p>The population naturally divides itself into two portions,
    connected with the character of its surface&mdash;the countries
    to the north and the south of the mountains of Kong and the
    Jebel-al-Komr. To the north of this line of demarcation, are
    the kingdoms of the foreign conquerors, who have driven the
    original natives to the mountains, or have subjected them as
    slaves. This is the Mahometan land. To the south of this line
    dwells the Negro, in a region a large portion of which is too
    fiery for European life. This is Central Africa; distinguished
    from all the earth by the unspeakable mixture of squalidness
    and magnificence, simplicity of life yet fury of passion,
    savage ignorance of its religious notions yet fearful worship
    of evil powers, its homage to magic, and desperate belief in
    spells, incantations and the <i>fetish</i>. The configuration
    of the country, so far as it can be conjectured, assists this
    primeval barbarism. Divided by natural barriers of hill, chasm,
    or river, into isolated states, they act under a general
    impulse of hostility and disunion. If they make peace, it is
    only for purposes of plunder; and, if they plunder, it is only
    to make slaves. The very fertility of the soil, at once
    rendering them indolent and luxurious, excites their passions,
    and the land is a scene alike of profligacy and profusion. To
    the south of this vast region lies a third&mdash;the land of
    the Caffre, occupying the eastern coast, and, with the
    Betjouana and the Hottentot, forming the population of the most
    promising portion of the continent. But here another and more
    enterprising race have fixed themselves; and the great English
    colony of the Cape, with its dependent settlements, has begun
    the first real conquest of African barbarism. Whether Aden may
    not act on the opposite coasts of the Red Sea, and Abyssinia
    become once more a Christian land; or whether even some impulse
    may not divinely come from Africa itself, are questions
    belonging <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271"
       name="page271"></a>[pg 271]</span> to the future. But there
       can scarcely be a doubt, that the existence of a great
       English viceroyalty in the most prominent position of South
       Africa, the advantages of its government, the intelligence
       of its people, their advancement in the arts essential to
       comfort, and the interest of their protection, their
       industry, and their example, must, year by year, operate in
       awaking even the negro to a feeling of his own powers, of
       the enjoyment of his natural faculties, and of that rivalry
       which stimulates the skill of man to reach perfection.</p>

    <p>The name of Africa, which, in the Punic tongue, signifies
    "ears of corn," was originally applied only to the northern
    portion, lying between the Great Desert and the shore, and now
    held by the pashalics of Tunis and Tripoli. They were then the
    granary of Rome. The name Lybia was derived from the Hebrew
    <i>Leb</i>, (heat,) and was sometimes partially extended to the
    continent, but was geographically limited to the provinces
    between the Great Syrtis and Egypt. The name Ethiopia is
    evidently Greek, (burning, or black, visage.)</p>

    <p>There is strong reason to believe that the Portuguese boast
    of the sixteenth century&mdash;the circumnavigation of
    Africa&mdash;was anticipated by the Phoenician sailors two
    thousand years and more. We have the testimony of Herodotus,
    that Necho, king of Egypt, having failed in an attempt to
    connect the Nile with the Red Sea by a canal, determine to try
    whether another route might not be within his reach, and sent
    Phoenician vessels from the Red Sea, with orders to sail round
    Africa, and return by the Mediterranean. It is not improbable
    that, from being unacquainted with the depth to which it
    penetrates the south, he had expected the voyage to be a brief
    one. It seems evident that the navigators themselves did not
    conceive that it could extend beyond the equator, from their
    surprise at seeing the sun rise on their <i>right hand</i>. The
    narrative tells us&mdash;"The Phoenicians, taking their course
    from the Red Sea, entered into the Southern Ocean on the
    approach of autumn; they landed in Lybia, planted corn, and
    remained till the harvest. They then sailed again. After having
    thus spent two years, they passed the Columns of Hercules in
    the third, and returned to Egypt." Herodotus doubted their
    story&mdash;"Their relation," says the honest old Greek, "may
    obtain belief from others, but to me it seems incredible; for
    they affirmed, that, having sailed round Africa, they <i>had
    the sun on their right hand</i>. Thus was Africa for the first
    time known."</p>

    <p>Thus the very circumstance which the old historian regarded
    as throwing doubt on the discovery, is now one of the strongest
    corroborations of its truth.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
       "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> There appear to have been
       several attempts to sail along the west coast, by ancient
       expeditions; but to the Portuguese is due the modern honour
       of having first sailed round the Cape. From 1412, the
       Portuguese, under a race of adventurous princes, had
       extended their discoveries; but it occupied them sixty years
       to reach the Line, and nearly thirty years more to reach the
       Cape, which they first called Cabo Tormentoso, (Stormy
       Cape.) But the king gave it the more lucky, though the less
       poetical, title which it now bears.</p>

    <p>The triumph of Columbus, in his discovery of the New World
    in 1493, raised the emulation of the Portuguese, then regarded
    as the first navigators in the world; yet it was not until four
    years after, that their expedition was sent, to equalize the
    stupendous accession to the Spanish domains, by the possession
    of the East. In July 1497, Gama sailed, reached Calicut May 2,
    1498, and returned to Portugal, covered with well-earned
    renown, after a voyage of upwards of two years.</p>

    <p>Having given this brief outline of the divisions and
    character of the mighty continent, which seemed important to
    the better understanding of the immediate subject, we revert to
    the intelligent and animated volumes of Captain (now Major)
    Harris.</p>

    <p>A letter from the Bombay government, 29th April 1841, gave
    him this distinguished credential:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page272"
           name="page272"></a>[pg 272]</span> "SIR&mdash;I am
           directed to inform you that the Honourable the Governor
           in Council, having formed a very high estimate of your
           talents and acquirements, and of the spirit of
           enterprise and decision, united with prudence and
           discretion, exhibited in your recently published travels
           through the territories of the Maselakatze to the Tropic
           of Capricorn, has been pleased to select you to conduct
           the mission which the British Government has resolved to
           send to Sahela Selasse, the king of Shoa, in Southern
           Abyssinia, whose capital, Ankober, is supposed to be
           about four hundred miles inland from the port of Tajura,
           on the African coast."</p>

        <p>[Then followed the mention of the vessels appointed to
        carry the mission.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>(Signed) "J.P. WILLOUGHBY,"</p>

            <p>"Secretary to Government."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The persons comprising the mission were Major W.C. Harris,
    Bombay Engineers, Captain Douglas Graham, Bombay army,
    principal assistant, with others, naturalists, draftsmen,
    &amp;c., and an escort of two sergeants and fifteen rank and
    file, volunteers from H.M. 6th foot and the Bombay
    Artillery.</p>

    <p>On the afternoon of a sultry day in April, Major Harris,
    with his gallant and scientific associates, embarked on board
    the East India Company's steam ship Auckland, in the harbour of
    Bombay, on their voyage to the kingdom of Shoa in Southern
    Abyssinia, in the year 1841. The steam frigate pursued her way
    prosperously through the waters, and on the ninth day was
    within sight of Cape Aden, after a voyage of 1680 miles. The
    Cape, named by the natives, Jebel Shemshan, rises nearly 1800
    feet above the ocean, is frequently capped with clouds, a wild
    and fissured mass of rock, and evidently intended by nature for
    one of those great beacons which announce the approach to an
    inland sea. On rounding the Cape, the British eye was delighted
    with the sight of the Red Sea squadron, riding at anchor within
    the noble bay. The arrival of the frigate also caused a
    sensation on the shore; and Major Harris happily describes the
    feelings with which a new arrival is hailed by the British
    garrison on that dreary spot, their only excitement being the
    periodical visits of the packets between Suez and Bombay. In
    the dead of the night a blue light shoots up in the offing. It
    is answered by the illumination of the block ship, then the
    thunder of her guns is heard, then, as she nears the shore, the
    flapping of her paddles is heard through the silence, then the
    spectral lantern appears at the mast-head, and then she rushes
    to her anchorage, leaving in her wake a long phosphoric
    train.</p>

    <p>Wherever England drops an anchor a new scene of existence
    has begun. At Aden, the supply of coals for the steam-ships has
    introduced a new trade; gangs of brawny Seedies, negroes from
    the Zanzibar coast, but fortunately enfranchised, make a
    livelihood by transferring the coal from the depots on shore to
    the steamers. Though the most unmusical race in the world, they
    can do nothing without music, but it is music of their
    own&mdash;a tambourine beaten with the thigh-bone of a calf;
    but their giant frames go through prodigious labour, carry
    immense sacks, and drink prodigious draughts to wash the
    coal-dust down. Such is the furious excitement with which they
    rush into this repulsive operation, that Major Harris thinks
    that for every hundred tons of coal thus embarked, at least one
    life is sacrificed; those strong savages, at once inflamed by
    drink, and overcome with toil, throwing themselves down on the
    dust or the sand, to rise no more. This shows the advantage of
    English philosophy: our coal-heavers in the Thames toil as
    much, are nearly as naked, nearly as black, and probably drink
    more; but we never hear of their dying in a fit of rapture in
    the embrace of a coal-sack. When the day is done, drunk or
    sober, washed or unwashed, they go home to their wives, sleep
    untroubled by the cares of kings, and return to fresh dust,
    drink, and dirt, next morning.</p>

    <p>The coast of Arabia has no claims to the picturesque: all
    its charms, like those of the oyster, lie within the roughest
    of possible shells. Its first aspect resembles heaps of the
    cinders of a glass-house&mdash;a building whose heat seems to
    be fully realized by the temperature of this fearful place.
    England has a resident there, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page273"
       name="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span> Captain Haynes,named as
       political agent. That any human being, who could exist in
       any other place, would remain in Aden, is one of the wonders
       of human nature. An officer, of course, must go wherever he
       is sent; but such is the innate love for a post, that if
       this gallant and intelligent person were roasted to death,
       as might happen in one of the coolest days of the Ethiopian
       summer, there would be a thousand applications before a
       month was over, to the Foreign Office, for the honour of
       being carbonaded on the rocks of Aden.</p>

    <p>The promontory has all the marks of volcanic eruption, and
    is actually recorded, by an Arab historian of the tenth
    century, to have been thrown up about that period. "Its sound,
    like the rumbling of thunder, might then be heard many miles,
    and from its entrails vomited forth redhot stones, with a flood
    of liquid fire." The crater of the extinguished volcano is
    still visible, though shattered and powdered down by the tread
    under which Alps and Appennines themselves crumble
    away&mdash;that of Time. The only point on which we are
    sceptical is the late origin of the promontory. Nothing beyond
    a sandhill or a heap of ashes has been produced on the face of
    nature since the memory of man. That a rock, or rather a
    mountain chain, with a peak 1800 feet high, should have been
    produced at any time time within the last four thousand years,
    altogether tasks our credulity. The powers of nature are now
    otherwise employed than in rough-hewing the surface of the
    globe. She has been long since, like the sculptor, employed in
    polishing and finishing&mdash;the features were hewn out long
    ago. Her master-hand has ever since been employed in smoothing
    them.</p>

    <p>Aden's reputation for barrenness is an old one&mdash;"Aden,"
    says Ben Batuta of Tangiers, "is situate upon the sea-shore; a
    large city without either seed, water, or tree." This was
    written five hundred years ago; yet the ruins of fortifications
    and watch-towers along the rocks, show that even this human
    oven was the object of cupidity in earlier times; and the
    British guns, bristling among the precipices, show that the
    desire is undecayed even in our philosophic age.</p>

    <p>Yet the Arab imagination has created its wonders even in
    this repulsive scene; and the generation of monkeys which
    tenant the higher portion of the rocks, are declared by Arab
    tradition to be the remnant of the once powerful tribe of Ad,
    changed into apes by the displeasure of Heaven, when "the King
    of the World," Sheddad, renowned in eastern story,
    presumptuously dared to form a garden which should rival
    Paradise. The prophet Hud remonstrated; but his remonstrances
    went for nothing, and the indignant monarch and his courtiers
    suddenly found their visages simious, their tongues chattering,
    and their lower portions furnished with tails&mdash;a species
    of transformation, which, so far as regards visage and tongue,
    is supposed to be not unfrequent among courtiers to this day.
    But this showy tradition goes further still. The Bostan al Irem
    (Garden of Paradise) is believed still to exist in the deserts
    of Aden; though geographers differ on its position. It still
    retains its domes and bowers&mdash;both of indescribable
    beauty; its crystal fountains, and its walks strewed with
    pearls for sand. It is true, that no living man can absolutely
    aver that he has seen this place of wonders; but that is a mere
    result of our very wicked age. This has not been always the
    case; for Abdallah Ibn Aboo Kelaba passed a night in its palace
    in the reign of Moowiych, the prince of the Faithful. Lucky the
    man who shall next find it, but unlucky the world when he does;
    for then the day of the general conflagration will be at hand.
    In the mean time, it remains, like the top of Mount Meru,
    covered with clouds, or, like the inside of a Chinese puzzle, a
    work of unrivaled art, conceivable but intangible by man.</p>

    <p>In this pleasant mingling of fact, visible to his shrewd
    eye, and fiction drawn from ancient fancy, Major Harris leads
    us on. But Aden is not yet exhausted of wonders&mdash;an island
    in its bay, Seerah, (the fortified black isle,) is pronounced
    to have been the refuge of Cain on the murder of Abel; and its
    volcanic and barren chaos is no unequal competitor for the
    honour with the rocks of the Caucasus.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page274"
       name="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span> But England, which
       changes every thing, is changing all this. Within the next
       generation, the railway will run down the romances of
       Nutrib; a cotton manufactory will send up its smokes to blot
       out the celestial blue by day, and shoot forth its sullen
       illumination by night, over the anointed soil; the minstrel
       will turn policeman, and the sheik be a justice of peace;
       political economy will have its itinerant lecturers,
       enlightening the Bedouins on the principles of rent and
       taxes; the city will have a lord mayor and corporation of
       the deepest black; the volcano will be planted with villas;
       turnpikes will measure out the sands; a hotel will flourish
       on the summit of Jebel Shemshan; and Aden will differ from
       Liverpool in nothing but being two thousand miles further
       from the smoke and multitudes of London.</p>

    <p>The Arab is still the prominent person among the native
    population of this territory. Major Harris describes him well.
    The bronzed and sunburnt visage, surrounded by long matted
    locks of raven hair; the slender but wiry and active frame, and
    the energetic gait and manner, proclaimed the untamable
    descendant of Ishmael. He nimbly mounts the crupper of his now
    unladen dromedary, and at a trot moves down the bazar. A
    checked kerchief round his brows, and a kilt of dark blue
    calico round his frame, comprise his slender costume. His arms
    have been deposited outside the Turkish wall; and as he looks
    back, his meagre, ferocious aspect, flanked by that tangled web
    of hair, stamps him the roving tenant of the desert. It is
    curious to find in this remote country a custom similar to that
    of the fiery cross, which in old times summoned the Celtic
    tribes to arms. On the alarm of invasion, a branch, torn by the
    priest from the <i>nebek</i>, (a tree bearing a fruit like the
    Siberian crab,) is lighted in the fire, the flame is then
    quenched in the blood of a newly slaughtered ram. It is then
    sent forth with a messenger to the nearest clan. Thus, great
    numbers are assembled with remarkable promptitude. In the
    invasion under Ibrahim Pasha, sixteen thousand of these wild
    warriors were assembled from one tribe. They crept into the
    Egyptian camp by night, and, using only their daggers, made
    such formidable slaughter, that the Pasha was glad to escape by
    a precipitate retreat.</p>

    <p>The Jews form an important part of the population, as
    artizans and manufacturers. Feeling the natural veneration for
    the Chosen People in all their misfortunes, and convinced that
    the time will come when those misfortunes will be obliterated,
    it is highly gratifying to find, that even in this place of
    their ancient sufferings, they are beginning to feel the
    benefit of British protection. Hitherto, through their
    indefatigable industry, having acquired opulence in Arabia as
    elsewhere, they were afraid either to display or to enjoy it;
    but now, under the protection of the British flag, they not
    merely enjoy their wealth, but they publicly practise the
    rights of their religion. Stone slabs with Hebrew inscriptions
    mark the place of their dead. They have schools for the
    education of their children; and their men and women, arrayed
    in their holiday apparel, sit fearlessly in the synagogue, and
    listen to the reading of the law and the prophets, as of old.
    It is a great source of gratification to the philanthropist to
    find, that wherever England extends her power, industry,
    commerce, and peace are the natural result. Aden, barren as the
    soil is, is evidently approaching to a prosperity which it
    never possessed even in its most flourishing days. Emigrants
    from Yemen and from both shores of the Red Sea, are daily
    crowding within the walls, through the security which they
    offer against native oppression. In the short space of three
    years, the population has risen to twenty thousand souls.
    Substantial dwellings are rising up in every quarter, and at
    all the adjacent ports hundreds of native merchants are only
    waiting the erection of permanent fortifications, in token of
    our intending to remain, to flock under the guns with their
    families and wealth. The opinion of this intelligent writer is,
    that Aden, as a free port, whilst she pours wealth into a now
    impoverished land, must erelong become the queen of the
    adjacent seas, and rank amongst the most useful dependencies of
    the British crown.</p>

    <p>The mission having remained some <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page275"
       name="page275"></a>[pg 275]</span> time at Aden, to purchase
       horses and stores, sailed on the 15th May; and, on losing
       sight of Aden, the members of the mission characteristically
       took the "Pilgrims' vow" not to shave until their return. On
       the 17th they opened the town of Tajura, on the verge of a
       broad expanse of blue water, over which a gossamerlike fleet
       of fishing catamarans already plied their craft. Their
       pilot, an old Arab, was a man of fun, and the specimens of
       his tongue are good. In some reference to the anchorage, he
       said, "Now if we only had two-fathom Ali here, you would not
       have all these difficulties. When they want to lay out an
       anchor, they have nothing to do but to hand it over to Ali,
       and he walks away with it into six or eight feet without any
       ado. I went once upon a time in the dark to grope for a
       berth on board of his buggalow, and, stumbling over some
       one's toes, enquired to whom they belonged. 'To Ali,' was
       the reply. 'And whose knees are these?' said I, after
       walking half across the deck. 'Ali's.' 'And this head in the
       scuppers, pray whose is it?' 'Ali's; what do you want with
       it?' 'Ali again!' I exclaimed; 'then I must even look for
       stowage elsewhere.'"</p>

    <p>The sight of a shark in the harbour let loose the old jester
    again. "A friend of mine," said he, "pilot of a vessel almost
    as fast a sailer as my own, which is acknowledged to be the
    best in these seas, was bound to Mocha with camels on board.
    When off the high table-land betwixt the Bay of Tajura and the
    Red Sea, one of the beasts dying, was hove overboard. Up came a
    shark ten times the size of that fellow there, and swallowed
    the camel, leaving only his hinder legs sticking out of his
    jaws; but before he had time to think where he was to find
    stowage for it, up came another tremendous fellow and bolted
    the shark, camel, legs, and all."</p>

    <p>In return for this anecdote, the major gave him the story of
    the two Kilkenny cats in the saw-pit, which fought, until
    nothing remained of either but the tail and a bit of the flue.
    The old pilot doubted. "How can that be?" said he, revolving
    the business seriously in his mind. "As for the story I have
    told you, it is as true as the Koran."</p>

    <p>After a short stay and presentation to the Sultan of Tajura,
    a slave-port, with a miserable old man for its master, the
    mission once more set forth for Shoa; yet even here we glean a
    specimen of Arab speech. "Trees attain not to their growth in a
    single day," said an Arab, when remonstrating with the sultan
    on his inordinate love of lucre. "Take the tree as your text,
    and learn that property is to be gathered only by slow
    degrees." "True," said the old miser; "but, sheik, you must
    have lost sight of the fact, that my leaves are already
    withered, and that, if I would be rich, I have not a moment to
    lose."</p>

    <p>The packing up for the journey was a new source of trouble;
    every camel-driver found fault with his load. However, at
    length every article was stowed, except a hand-organ and a few
    stand of arms. At length, a great hulking savage offered to
    take the arms, provided they were cut in two to suit the back
    of his animals. We have then another instance of Arab drollery.
    "You are a tall man," said the old pilot; "suppose we shorten
    you by the legs." "No, no," said the barbarian, "I am flesh and
    blood, and shall be spoiled." "So will the contents of these
    cases, you offspring of an ass," said the old man, "if you
    divide them."</p>

    <p>The progress to the interior from the port of Tajura, led
    them over immense ranges of basaltic cliffs, where the heat of
    the sun was felt with an intensity scarcely conceivable by
    European feelings. In this land of fire, the road skirting the
    base of a barren range covered with heaps of lava blocks, and
    its foot marked by piles of stones, the memorials of deeds of
    blood, the lofty conical peak of Jebel Seearo rose in sight,
    and not long afterwards the far-famed Lake Assad, surrounded by
    its dancing mirage, was seen sparkling at its base.</p>

    <p>The first glimpse of this phenomenon, "though curious, was
    far from pleasing"&mdash;"an elliptical basin, seven miles in
    its transverse axis, filled half with smooth water of the
    deepest cerulean hue, and half with a sheet of glittering
    snow-white salt, girded on three sides by huge hot-looking
    mountains, that dip their basins into its very bowl, and on the
    fourth by crude, half-formed rocks of lava, broken and divided
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276"
       name="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span> by chasms. No sound broke
       on the ear, not a ripple played on the water. The molten
       surface of the lake lay like burnished steel, the fierce sky
       was without a cloud, and the angry sun, like a ball of metal
       at a white heat, rode in full blaze."</p>

    <p>It is scarcely wonderful, that among a people devoted to
    superstition, those terrible passes and sultry hollows should
    be marked as the haunts of the powers of evil. Adyli, a deep
    mysterious cavern at the extremity of one of those melancholy
    plains, is believed to be the especial abode of gins and
    <i>afreets</i>, whose voices are heard in the night, and who
    carry off the traveller to devour him without remorse. A late
    instance was mentioned of a man who was compelled by the
    weariness of his camel to fall behind the caravan, and who left
    no remnants behind him but his spear and shield. Major Harris
    well describes this spot as one which, from its desolate
    position, might be believed to be the last stage of the
    habitable world. "A close mephitic stench, impeding
    respiration, arose from the saline exhalations of the stagnant
    lake. A frightful glare from the white salt and limestone
    hillocks threatened extinction to the vision, and a sickening
    heaviness in the loaded atmosphere was enhanced rather than
    alleviated by the fiery breath of the north-westerly wind,
    which blew without interruption during the day. The air was
    inflamed, the sky sparkled, and columns of burning sand, which
    at quick intervals towered high into the atmosphere, became so
    illumined as to appear like tall pillars of fire. Crowds of
    horses, mules, and camels, tormented to madness by the
    poisonous gad-fly, flocked to share the only bush; and,
    disputing with their heels the slender shelter it afforded,
    compelled several of the party to seek refuge in caves formed
    below by fallen masses of volcanic rock, heated to the
    temperature of a potter's kiln, and fairly baking up the marrow
    in the bones." The heat in this place, with the thermometer
    under the shade of cloaks and umbrellas, was at 126&deg;. It is
    only surprising how any of the party survived. Certainly if
    Abyssinia is to be approached only by this road, the prospect
    of an intercourse with it from the east, appears among the most
    improbable things of this world.</p>

    <p>One of the advantages of continental travel has been long
    since said to be, its teaching us how many comfortable things
    we enjoy at home; and it appears that no Englishman can
    comprehend the value of that despised fluid, fresh water, until
    he has left the precincts of his own fortunate land: but it is
    in Africa, and peculiarly on this Abyssinian high-road, that
    the value of a draught of spring water is to be especially
    estimated. "Since leaving the shores of India," says Major
    Harris, "the party had gradually been in training towards a
    disregard of dirty water. On board a ship of any description,
    the fluid is seldom very clear or very plentiful. At Cape Aden,
    there was little perceptible difference between the sea water
    and the land water. At Tajura, the beverage obtainable was far
    from being improved in quality by the taint of the new skins in
    which it was transferred from the only well; and now, in the
    very heart of the scorching Tehama, where a copious draught of
    pure water seemed absolutely indispensable every five minutes,
    the mixture was the very acme of abomination. Fresh hides
    stript from the he-goat, besmeared inside as well as out with
    old tallow and strong bark tan, filled from an impure well at
    Sagallo, tossed and tumbled during two days and nights under a
    distilling heat," formed a drink which we should conclude to be
    little short of poison. However, the human throat learns to
    accommodate itself to every thing in time, and the time came
    when even this abomination was longed for.</p>

    <p>But the worst was not yet come. It was midnight when the
    party commenced the steep ascent of the south-eastern boundary
    of the lake, a ridge of volcanic rocks. "The north-east wind
    had scarcely diminished its parching fierceness, and in hot
    suffocating gusts swept over the glittering expanse of water
    and salt, where the moon shone brightly; each deadly puff
    succeeded by the stillness that foretells a tropical hurricane.
    The prospect around was wild&mdash;beetling, basaltic cones,
    and jagged slabs of shattered lava."</p>

    <p>The path itself was formidable, <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page277"
       name="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span> winding along the crest
       of the ridge over sheets of broken lava, with scarcely more
       than sufficient width to admit of the progress in single
       file. "The horrors of this dismal night set all description
       at defiance." The hope of water, though at the distance of
       sixteen miles, excited them for a while; but at length even
       this excitement failed. And "owing to the heat, fasting, and
       privation, the limbs of the weaker refused the task, and
       after the first two miles they dropped fast into the rear.
       Under the fiery blast of the midnight sirocco the cry for
       water, uttered feebly and with difficulty by numbers of
       parched throats, now became incessant; and the supply for
       the whole party falling short of a gallon and a half, it was
       not long to be answered. A tiny sip of diluted vinegar for a
       moment assuaged the burning thirst which raged in the
       vitals; but its effects were transient, and, after
       struggling a few steps, they sank again, declaring their
       days to be numbered, and their resolution to rise up no
       more. Dogs incontinently expired upon the road, horses and
       mules that once lay down were abandoned to their fate; while
       the lion-hearted soldier, who had braved death at the
       cannon's mouth, subdued and unmanned by thirst, lay gasping
       by the wayside, hailing approaching dissolution with
       delight, as the termination of tortures which were no longer
       to be endured. As another day dawned, and the "round red
       sun" again rose over the lake of salt, the courage even of
       those who had borne up against this fiery trial began to
       flag: "a dimness came before the drowsy eyes, giddiness
       seized the brain, and the hope held out by the guides, of
       water in advance, seemed like the delusion of a dream."</p>

    <p>In this crisis, at which our chief wonder is, that Major
    Harris and his explorers were ever heard of again, or had left
    any memorials of themselves but their bones, a wild Bedouin was
    seen, "like a delivering angel," hurrying forward with a large
    skin, filled with muddy water. This well-timed supply was
    divided among the fainting people: a quantity was poured over
    the face and down the throat of each; and at a late hour,
    "ghastly, haggard, and exhausted, like men who had escaped from
    the jaws of death, the whole had contrived to straggle into a
    camp, which, but for the foresight and firmness of the son of
    Ali Abi,(who had sent the water,) few individuals would have
    reached alive."</p>

    <p>After traversing this terrible desert of fifty miles&mdash;a
    barrier to all general and commercial intercourse, which we
    should think impassable, however it might be overcome by a
    small party of bold and hardy men, well led, furnished with
    every supply, water excepted, which could sustain them through
    its horrors, (and which yet, through that single want, had
    nearly perished)&mdash;they persued a long and dlifficult march
    through a dreary country, scantily peopled, dotted with robber
    clans, and exhibiting impediments of all kinds in the knavery
    and villany of the native authorities; until they reached the
    borders of Abyssinia. We had by no means been aware that
    volcanoes had made so large a share of this portion of Africa.
    The whole border seems to be volcanic, and to retain in its
    blasted and broken surface, evidence of its having been, in
    remote ages, perhaps in the earliest, the scene of most intense
    and general volcanic action.</p>

    <p>In Major Harris's animated description&mdash;"singular and
    interesting indeed is the wild scenery in the vicinity of the
    treacherous oasis of Sultelli. A field of extinct volcanic
    cones, vomited out of the entrails of the earth, and each
    encircled by a black belt of vitrified lava, environs it on
    three sides; and of these Mount Abida, three thousand feet in
    height, whose cup, enveloped in clouds, stretches some two and
    a half miles in <i>diameter</i>, would seem to be the parent.
    Beyond, the still loftier crater of Aiulloo, the ancient
    landmark of the now-decayed empire of Ethiopia, is visible in
    dim perspective; and, looming hazily in the extreme distance,
    is the great blue Abyssinian range."</p>

    <p>In any part of Africa a river of tolerable magnitude is an
    object of the most anxious interest; and the approach to the
    Hawash, the boundary river of the kingdom of Shoa, was looked
    to with eager speculation. At length the height was reached
    from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278"
       name="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span> which was obtained "an
       exhilarating prospect over the dark, lone valley of the long
       looked-for Hawash. The course of the river was marked by a
       dense belt of trees and verdure, stretching towards the base
       of the great mountain range, of which the cloud-capped cone,
       which frowns over the capital of Shoa, forms the most
       conspicuous feature." The mission now began to
       exalt:&mdash;"Though still far distant, the ultimate
       destination of the embassy appeared almost to have been
       gained, and none had an idea of the length of time that must
       elapse before his foot should press the soil of Ankober." A
       day of intense heat was as usual followed by a heavy fall of
       rain, which, owing to the unaccommodating arrangement of
       striking the tents at sunset, thoroughly drenched the whole
       party.</p>

    <p>The new difficulty was, how to cross the Hawash, "second of
    the rivers of Abyssinia, and rising in the very heart of
    Ethipoia, at an elevation of 8000 feet above the sea. It is fed
    by niggardly tributaries from the high bulwarks of Shoa and
    Efat, and flows, like a great artery, through the arid plains
    of the Adaiel, green and wooded throughout its long course, and
    finally absorbed in the lagoons of Aussa. The canopy of fleecy
    clouds, which, as mid-day dawned, hung thick and heavy over the
    lofty blue peaks beyond, gave sad presage of the deluge that
    was pouring between its verdant banks from the higher regions
    of the source."</p>

    <p>The party now descended to enjoy the real luxuries of shade
    and water, in a region where they had hitherto seen nothing but
    salt and lava. At first thinly wooded, they found the soil
    covered with tall rank grass, from which, however, the
    perpetual incursions of the robber tribes scare the flocks and
    herds. Deeper down, they entered among gum-bearing acacias and
    fruit-trees. "Guinea-fowl rose before them, groves of tamarisk,
    ringing to the voice of the bell-bird, flanked every open
    glade, and the fractured branches of the nobletrees gave proof
    of the presence of the most ponderous of the mammalia."</p>

    <p>Forcing their way, with some difficulty, through this
    jungle, they obtained their first near view of the river, a
    "deep volume of turbid water," covered with drift wood, and
    rolling, at the rate of three miles an hour, between clayey
    walls twenty-five feet in height. The breadth fell short of
    sixty yards, but the flood was not yet at its maximum. Willows,
    drooping over the stream, were festooned with recent drift,
    hanging many feet above the level of the banks; and it was
    evident that the waters had lately been out, to the overflowing
    of the country for many miles. The river, now upwards of 2200
    feet above the level of the ocean forms, in this quarter, the
    nominal boundary of the kingdom of Shoa.</p>

    <p>They were now on "the spot which exhibited the forest life
    of Africa." In a lake adjoining the river, the hippopotamus
    "rolled his unwieldy carcass to the surface, and floating
    crocodiles, protruding his snout to blow a snort that might be
    heard at the distance of a mile." An unfortunate donkey, which
    had been partly drowned and partly strangled, was thrown out of
    the camp. No sooner had night fallen, than this prey roused the
    appetites of the whole forest, the howl and growl of wild
    beasts was heard at their banquet on the donkey throughout the
    night. Lightening played over the woods; the "violent snapping
    of the branches proclaimed the nocturnal movements of the
    elephant and hippopotamus;" the loud roar and startling snort
    were constantly heard; and by morning every vestige of the dead
    animal, even to the skull, had disappeared.</p>

    <p>Africa, in all its provinces, is the scene of the boldest
    field sports in the world&mdash;India and its tigers, perhaps,
    excepted. But Africa excels even India in the variety and
    multitude of its mighty savages&mdash;lions, elephants,
    panthers, and hippopotami; the sands, the forests, the jungles,
    the rivers, the marshes, every thing and place abounds with
    brute life, on the largest, the boldest, and the fiercest
    scale. Africa, with the human race on the lowest grade, has the
    brute on the highest, and its true name is the great kingdom of
    savage nature.</p>

    <p>A two-ounce ball had been lodged in the forehead of
    hippopotamus on the evening of reaching the Hawash;
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279"
       name="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span> but the animal having
       dived, the natives, in some jealousy of the skill of the
       British rifle, declared that it had not been mortally
       struck. The next dawn, however, decided the question, for
       the "freckled pink sides of a dead hippopotamus were to be
       seen high above the surface, as the distended carcass
       floated like a monstrous buoy at anchor." Hawsers were
       carried out with all diligence, and the "colossus" was towed
       ashore amidst the acclamations of the whole caravan. Then
       came a native scene. A tribe of savages, who had waited,
       squatting, to see the arrival of the monster, threw aside
       their bows and arrows, and, stripping its thick hide from
       the ribs, attacked it with the vigour of an African horde.
       Donkeys and women were laden with incredible despatch, and,
       "staggering under huge flaps of meat," the savages went
       their way.</p>

    <p>The soil now became swampy, yet only the more filled with
    animal existence. LE ADO, (the White Water,) a lake which they
    skirted, of two miles' diameter, was the haunt of countless
    wild-fowl, geese, mallards, teal, herons, flamingoes. A party
    of Bedouin women deposed to having seen another "party" of
    elephants taking a bath in the spot half an hour before, and
    the prints of their huge feet in the moist sands corroborated
    the testimony. Hideously withered women followed the march of
    the mission, carrying curds, and covered over with marsh-flies.
    Above, vast flights of locusts, which had stripped the coast,
    were pouring in towards Abyssinia. "They quite darkened the
    air" where the caravan halted; and above them again were a host
    of adjutant birds, sometimes bursting down through the mass,
    and then stooping to the ground, and stalking along to devour
    the killed and wounded. This is the land, too, of the
    hurricane. Nature is queen or tyrant here; the thunder tears
    the sensorium; the lightning burns out the eyes; the rain is a
    cataract; the hall is a continued volley of ice; the clouds
    stoop to earth, and bury the daylight like a shroud; the rivers
    become torrents; the dry plain becomes first a swamp, and then
    a sea. Tents and tarpaulins are useless to keep out the deluge
    from above, or are beaten down by its weight on the heads of
    the unfortunates who trust to them for shelter, until at length
    the caravan, stripped of all covering, has no resource but to
    bide the pelting of the pitiless storm, and, shivering and
    shelterless, wait until the hurricane has howled itself
    away.</p>

    <p>At length they reached the city of Furri, loaded, for the
    thirty-fifth time, with the baggage of the British embassy. The
    caravan, escorted by a detachment of three hundred matchlock
    men, with flutes playing, and muskets echoing, and the heads of
    the warriors decorated with white plumes, on the 16th July
    entered the frontier town of the kingdom of Efat. Clusters of
    conical-roofed houses, covering the sides of twin hills, here
    presented the first permanent habitations that had greeted the
    eye since leaving the sea-coast&mdash;rude and ungainly, but
    right welcome signs of transition from depopulated waste to the
    abodes of man. The African seems a robber by nature, and the
    sight of the bales and boxes excited the national propensity in
    a most violent degree. Even the royal ministers and courtiers
    seem to have felt a passion for looking into those prohibited
    treasures, which evidently tempted their virtue in a most
    perilous degree. Meanwhile a special messenger arrived, bearing
    reiterated compliments from the Negoos, (king,) with a horse
    and a mule from the royal stud, attired in the peculiar
    trappings which belong to majesty. Those animals awoke all the
    loyal curiosity of the people. At the sight women and girls,
    enveloped in blood-red shifts, who had thronged to stare at the
    strangers, burst into a scream of acclamation. A group of
    hooded widows thrust their fingers into their ears and joined
    in the clamour. The escort and camel-drivers placed no bounds
    to their hilarity. A fat ox, that had been promised, was turned
    loose among the spectators, pursued by fifty savages with their
    gleaming <i>creeses</i>, and hamstrung by a dexterous blow,
    which threw it bellowing to the earth in the height of its mad
    career, and tribes of lean curs commenced an indiscriminate
    engagement over the garbage.</p>

    <p>The neighbouring nations look upon the population of this
    province with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280"
       name="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span> great contempt. They say
       that their tongues are long for lying, their arms are long
       for stealing, and their legs are long for running away.</p>

    <p>The mission now approached another region, perhaps the
    finest in Africa. Every change in the climate and soil in
    Africa is in extremes, and barreness and unbounded fertility
    lie side by side.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"As if by the touch of the magician's wand, the scene
        now passes, in an instant, from parched wastes to the geen,
        and lovely islands of Abyssinia, presenting one scene of
        rich and thriving cultivation. The baggage having at length
        been consigned to the shoulders of six hundred grumbling
        Moslem porters&mdash;for here the camel, from the steepness
        of the hills, was useless&mdash;and forming a line, which
        extended upwards of a mile, the embassy, on the morning of
        the 17th, comnenced the ascent of the Abyssinian Alps; the
        flutes again played, the wild warriors of the escort again
        chanted their songs. It was a cool and lovely morning, and
        an invigorating breeze played over the mountains' side, on
        which, now less than ten degrees from the equator,
        flourished the vegetation of northern climes. The rough and
        stony road wound on, by a steep ascent, over hill and dale,
        now skirting some precipitous ascent, now dipping into the
        basin of some verdant hollow, where it suddenly emerged
        into a succession of shady lanes, bounded by flowering
        hedgerows."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>All this is so like England, and so unlike Africa, that we
    should suspect the major's memory to have been as active at
    least as his observation. But the work contains so much
    internal evidence of accuracy, independently of the confidence
    attached to the character of the intelligent writer himself,
    that we must believe the heart of Ethiopa to possess secnes
    that would be worthy of the heart of our own fresh and
    flower-bearing island. The scene which follows is quite
    Arcadian.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The wild rose, the fern, the lantana, and the
        honeysuckle, smiled round a succession of highly cultivated
        terraces, and on every eminence, stood a cluster of
        conically thatched houses, environed by green hedges, and
        partially embowered amid dark trees As the troop passed on,
        the peasant abandoned his occupation to gaze at the novel
        procession; while merry groups of hooded women, decked in
        scarlet and crimson left their avocations in the hut to
        welcome the king's guests with a shrill <i>ziroleet</i>,
        which ran from every hand. Birds warbled among the groves.
        At various turns of the road the prospect was rugged, wild,
        and beautiful. The first Christian village was soon
        revealed on the summit of a height. Three principal ranges
        of hills were next crossed in succession. Lastly, the view
        opened upon the wooded site of Ankober occupying a central
        position in a horseshoe crescent of mountains, still high
        above which enclose a magnificent amphitheatre of ten miles
        in diameter. This is clothed throughout with a splendid
        vigorous, and varied vegetation."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The embassy now halted, waiting for permission to enter the
    capital, and taking up their quarters in a town three thousand
    feet above Furri, on the frontier. The escort of the troop
    fired a salute on entering, and, as they marched along,
    performed the war dance. A veteran capered before the ranks
    with a drawn sword between his teeth, and the martial song was
    chorused by three hundred Christian throats. The prospect from
    this elevated point naturally struck the travellers with
    astonishment and admiration. The site of the town is only one
    of the thousand cones into which the mountain side is broken as
    it approaches the plain. The prospect over the plain was
    boundless, and countless villages met the eye upon the mountain
    slope. Wherever the plough could go, all was cultivated. Wheat,
    barley, Indian corn, beans, peas, cotton, and oil plant, throve
    luxuriantly round every hamlet. The regularly marked fields
    mounted in terraces to the height of three or four thousand
    feet, becoming, in their boundaries, more and more indistinct,
    until totally lost in the shadowy green side of Mamrat (the
    Mother of Grace.)</p>

    <p>This mountain is a wonder, shrouded in clouds whilst all was
    sunshine below. It is clothed with a dense forest, and ascends
    to an elevation of 13,000 feet above the sea. Here are
    collected, for security, the treasures of the monarch which
    have been amassing since the re-establishment of the kingdom,
    one hundred and fifty years since.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page281"
       name="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span> After remaining some time
       in the market-place, the governor of the town appeared, and
       conducted the mission to the house of an old Moslem woman,
       where they were to lodge for the night. The names of the
       three daughters, Major Harris observes, were worthy of the
       days of Prince Cherry and Fair Star. They were Eve, Sweet
       Limes, and Sunbeam. The ladies vacated the house with great
       good-humour; but it was low, intolerably filthy, and without
       bedding or food. The unfortunate mission had thus to spend a
       night, probably unequaled by their sufferings in the open
       field. Though so near the equator, they felt the cold
       severely; rain set in with great violence, pouring through
       the roof, and entering into the threshold. A fire was
       indispensable, yet they were nearly suffocated with smoke;
       they were devoured with insects, and in this torment and
       fever tossed till dawn. At the arrival of morning they
       received the disappointing message, that the king could not
       yet visit his capital, but that they might either seek him
       among the mountains, or wait for him where they were.</p>

    <p>Major Harris imputes this disappointment to the accidental
    opening of one of the boxes of presents. Royal cupidity had
    been so strongly excited by the conjectures of their contents,
    that the king had evidently been anxious, in the first
    instance, to hasten their delivery as much as possible. Gold
    and jewels were probably uppermost in the royal conceptions;
    but the box happening to contain only the leathern buckets
    belonging to the "galloper guns," the spectators were loud in
    their derision. "These," they exclaimed, "are but a poor
    people! What is their nation compared with the Amhara? for
    behold, in this trash, specimens of the offerings brought from
    their boasted land to the footstool of the mightiest of
    monarchs."</p>

    <p>The rainy season was now setting in, and the situation of
    the embassy became more comfortless from day to day. Notes were
    written, and answers received from the monarch, but the royal
    interview was still postponed, partly by the artifice of the
    knavish governors, who kept a longing eye on the presents, and
    partly by the barbarian etiquette of showing the natives the
    scorn with which their king was entitled to treat all the
    nations of the world.</p>

    <p>The residence of the mission in this comfortless place,
    however, gave a opportunity of acquiring considerable knowledge
    of the habits and commerce of the interior. The chief traffic
    is in slaves, but coffee is exported extensively from Hurrna,
    and large caravans three times in the year visit the ports,
    Zeyla and Barbara, laden with ivory, ostrich feathers, ghee,
    saffrons, gums, and myrrh. In return are brought blue and white
    calicoes, Indian piece goods, Indian prints, silks, and shawls,
    red cotton yarn, silk threads, beads, frankincense, copper
    wire, and zinc.</p>

    <p>A fortnight rolled away painfully in this detestable place,
    which was named Alio Amba, when a summons came from the monarch
    in these formal words:&mdash;"Tarry not by day, neither stay ye
    by night; for the heart of the father longeth to see his
    children, and let him not be disappointed."</p>

    <p>They now ascended through a country of romantic beauty, to
    Machalwan, the place appointed for the interview. The
    Abyssinian in charge of the embassy, was now sent forward to
    obtain permission to fire a salute of twenty-one guns on the
    arrival of the troop at the royal residence. This request
    seemed to have alarmed his majesty in no slight degree. The
    most romantic reports of the ordnance had gone before them. It
    was currently believed that their discharge was sufficient to
    set fire to the ground, to shiver rocks, and to dismantle
    mountain fastnesses. Men were said to have arrived, with
    "copper legs," who served those tremendous engines; and in
    alarm for the safety of his palace, capital, and treasures, the
    suspicious monarch still peremptorily insisted on withholding
    the desired license, until he should have seen the battery
    "with his own eyes." It rained incessantly during the night
    which preceded the day of presentation, and until the morning
    broke; when a great volume of white mist rose from the deep
    valleys, and drifted like a scene-curtain across the summit of
    the giant Mamrat. The whole troop now began to ascend the
    mountain; and, as they approached within sight of the stockaded
    palace, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282"
       name="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span> the escort commenced to
       fire their matchlocks. The view here is described as very
       lovely, and giving some conception of European variety of
       vegetation, with tropical luxuriance. Farm-houses, rich
       fields, foaming cascades, and bright green meadows covered
       with flowers, met the eye on every side; and above all
       towered the great Abyssinian range, some thousand feet
       perpendicularly overhead, with its summits crested with
       clouds. The crowd of spectators was immense, and were
       repelled only by strokes of the bamboo. At length a large
       tent was pitched for the reception of the embassy, the floor
       was strewed with heath, myrtles, and other aromatic shrubs;
       and the weather having cleared up, "the mission, radiant
       with plumes and gold embroidery, moved on." As they reached
       the precincts of the palace, the artillery fired a salute,
       which equally awed and astonished the multitude, the
       discharge being followed by universal shouts in the native
       tongue of&mdash;"Wonderful English! Well done, well
       done!"</p>

    <p>After several further stoppages, they entered the reception
    hall. It was circular, and showy. The lofty walls glittered
    with a profusion of silver ornaments, emblazoned shields,
    matchlocks, and double-barreled guns. Persian carpets and rugs
    of all sizes, colours, and patterns, covered the floors; and
    crowds of governors, chiefs, and officers of the court, in
    their holiday attire, stood in a posture of respect, uncovered
    to the girdle. Two wide alcoves receded on either side, in one
    of which blazed a cheerful wood fire, engrossed by indolent
    cats; while in the other, on a flowered satin ottoman,
    surrounded by withered slaves and juvenile pages, and supported
    by gay velvet cushions, lay "His most Christian majesty, Sahela
    Selasse!" The Dech Agulari (state doorkeeper,) as master of the
    ceremonies, stood with a rod of green rushes to preserve the
    exact distance of approach to royalty; and as the British
    entered and made their bows, pointed them to chairs, which
    done, it was commanded that all should be covered.</p>

    <p>The monarch was not unworthy of figuring in this pomp. Forty
    summers, of which eight-and-twenty had been passed on the
    throne, had slightly furrowed his forehead, and grizzled a full
    bushy head of hair, arranged in elaborate curls. But, though
    wanting the left eye, "the expression of his manly features,
    open, pleasing, and commanding, did not belie the character for
    impartial justice which he had obtained far and wide; even the
    robber tribes of the low country calling him a fine balance of
    gold."</p>

    <p>After the delivery of the ambassadorial letters, the
    exhibition commenced, which had so long been the envy of the
    courtiers, and probably the conversation of the kingdom. The
    presents were displayed. A rich Brussels carpet, which
    completely covered the hall, Cashmere shawls, and embroidered
    Delhi scarfs of resplendent hues, excited universal admiration.
    The finer specimens were handed to the king. As the various
    presents succeeded, the delight increased. A group of Chinese
    dancing figures, produced bursts of merriment; and when the
    European escort, in full uniform, with the sergeant at their
    head, marched into the hall, paced in front of the throne, and
    performed the manual and platoon exercises, amid ornamented
    clocks chiming, and musical boxes playing "God save the Queen,"
    his majesty appeared quite entranced. "But many and bright were
    the smiles that lighted up the royal features, as three hundred
    muskets, with bayonets fixed, were piled in front of the royal
    footstool. A buzz of mingled wonder and applause arose from the
    crowded courtiers; and the monarch's satisfaction now filled to
    overflowing. 'God will reward you,' he exclaimed&mdash;'for I
    cannot!'"</p>

    <p>But a more serious and a more striking display was still to
    follow. The artillery were to exhibit their powers; and the
    crowd rushed out, and scattered over the hill to see its
    practice. A sheet was attached to the opposite face of the
    ravine, the valley rang to the roar of the guns; and as the
    white cloth flew in shreds to the wind, under a rapid discharge
    of round shot, canister, and grape, amid the crumbling of the
    rock, and the rush of falling stones, shouts of admiration rang
    from hill to hill. This eventful evening was closed by
    testimonies of the king's satisfaction, in the shape of a huge
    pepper pie from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283"
       name="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span> the royal kitchen, with
       his commands that his children might feast; and a visit from
       the royal confessor, a dwarf enveloped in robes and turbans,
       and armed with silver cross and crosier. Seating himself in
       a chair, he delivered a speech, which affords as good a
       specimen of court oratory as any thing that we remember; and
       also shows the powerful effect of the presents on the
       courtly sensibilities. The speech was as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Forty years have rolled away since Asfa Woosen, on
        whose memory be peace! grandsire to our beloved monarch,
        saw in a dream that the red men were bringing into his
        kingdom, curious and beautiful commodities from countries
        beyond the great sea. The astrologers, on being commanded
        to give an interpretation thereof, predicted with one
        accord, that foreigners from the land of Egypt would come
        into Abysinia during his majesty's most illustrious reign;
        and that yet more and wealthier would follow in that of his
        son, and of his son's son, who should sit next upon the
        throne. Praise be unto God, that the dream and its
        interpretation have now been fulfilled! Our eyes, though
        they be old, have never beheld wonders until this day; and
        during the reign over Shoa of seven successive kings, no
        such miracles as these have been wrought in Ethiopia!!"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The embassy were now fixed under the protection of the
    monarch; and they were invited to join in the various displays
    and festivals of the new year, which the Abyssinians begin on
    the 10th of September. Of these, the cavalry review was by far
    the most showy, as well as the most suited to the gratification
    of the British officers. Some parts of this display seemed to
    have been borrowed from the days of European knighthood. The
    king's master of the horse advanced at the head of his
    squadrons of picked household cavalry, "the flower of the
    Christian lances." Ayto Melkoo, their leader, was arrayed in a
    party-coloured vest, surmounted by a crimson Arab fleece,
    handsomely studded with silver jets. A gilt embossed gauntlet
    encircled his right arm, from the wrist to the elbow; his targe
    and horse trappings glittered with a profusion of silver
    crosses and devices, and he looked a stately and martial
    figure, curveting at the head of his well-appointed
    lancers.</p>

    <p>This warrior, advancing with his line, galloped up in front,
    and made a speech in the manner of old heroic times, vaunting
    his past prowess and his present loyalty, his troopers
    accompanying the more succcessful parts of his speech by
    striking the lance upon the targe. At the close, he threw his
    spears upon the ground, unsheathed his two-edged falchion, gave
    a howl, which was answered by a roar from his horsemen, and a
    discharge of fire-arms; and the whole made a dash, and charged
    across the parade.</p>

    <p>At the royal command, the British now fired a salute of
    twenty-one guns, to the great wonder and astonishment of the
    wild Galla and the multitude of spectators. Thirteen governors,
    (of provinces, we presume,) clothed in the skins of lions and
    leopards and covered with silver chains, cuirasses, and
    gauntlets, emblems of their gallantry in the field, next passed
    before the king, each at the head of his troop, and each making
    a harangue. Abyssinia must be a very oratorical country. Last
    of all, came the tall, martial figure of Abegoz Moreteh, chief
    of the tributary Galla of the south, at the head of his legion,
    three thousand in number: this "sea of wild horsemen" moved in
    advance, to the sound of kettle-drums, their arms and
    decorations flashing in the sun, and their ample white robes
    and long sable hair streaming in the breeze. At the war-hoop of
    their leader, "with the rush of a hurricane the moving forest
    of lances disappeared under a cloud of dust." From <i>eight to
    ten thousand</i> cavalry were in the field; and the spectacle,
    which lasted from nine in the morning until five in the
    afternoon, was "exceedingly wild and impressive." But the most
    impressive display of all was to be supplied by the British.
    With fire-arms the people were acquainted already. The "brass
    galloper," though viewed with "wonderful respect," was still
    only an engine on a larger scale than those to which they were
    familiarized. But the rocket was a formidable and splendid
    novelty. Night had now thrown her mantle round the field, and,
    by the king's command, the rocket practice began; the first
    brilliant <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284"
       name="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span> rush into the air was
       matter of amazement to all. When the rocket started with a
       roar from its bed, men, women, and children fell on their
       faces&mdash;horses and mules broke from their
       tethers&mdash;and the warriors who had any heart remaining
       shouted aloud. The Galla tribes, who witnessed the
       explosion, ascribed the phenomenon to "potent medicines,"
       and declared, that since the Gyptzis (British) could, at
       pleasure, produce comets in the sky and rain fire down
       heaven, there was nothing for them but submission to the
       king's command.</p>

    <p>The review was followed, at some interval of time, by a more
    substantial display. Thrice in the year the king summons his
    rude militia for an inroad into some of the neighbouring lands;
    and, as he was particularly anxious to have the presence of the
    embassy on this occasion, and as they conceived it to offer the
    best opportunity of seeing the country, they accordingly
    accepted the invitation. As it is to be presumed that they had
    no intention of taking any personal part in this marauding
    expedition, we are not disposed to criticise their
    acquiescence; otherwise there could be no doubt whatever, that
    they had no right to assist the king of Shoa in his foray on
    his neighbours, more than they would have had a right to assist
    his neighbours in their attacks upon the king of Shoa.</p>

    <p>The march was peculiar, and even pompous, in its kind. It
    was extraordinary to see it preceded by a copy of the Holy
    Scriptures, under a canopy of scarlet cloth, and borne on a
    mule; but, it must be owned, accompanied by the "Ark of the
    cathedral of St Michael," which works miracles, and is regarded
    as a pledge of victory. Then came the king on a specially
    caparisoned mule, surrounded by his guard of shield-bearers,
    and flanked by matchlock-men; then came forty damsels, royal
    cooks, painted with ochre, and muffled in crimson-striped robes
    of cotton&mdash;a troop rigorously guarded by attendants with
    long white wands. Beyond these, as far as the eye could
    penetrate the clouds of dust, every hill and valley teemed with
    horsemen, camp-followers, sumpter-mules, and men carrying
    sheaves of spears, and leading caparisoned horses, all mixed in
    the most picturesque confusion. After a march of fifteen miles,
    the female cooks halted, like a flight of flamingoes, in a
    pretty, secluded valley. It was evident that the day's march
    was now at an end, and the army halted to bivouac for the
    night. In the centre of this straggling camp, which could not
    be less than five miles in diameter, was raised a suite of
    royal tents, consisting of a gay party-coloured marquee of
    Turkish manufacture, surrounded by twelve ample awnings of
    black serge, over which floated five crimson pennons,
    surmounted respectively by silver globes. There was something
    of African, or perhaps European, pomp in this proceeding. Until
    the royal tents were enclosed from the vulgar eye, the Negoos,
    ascending an adjacent eminence with his chiefs and an escort of
    picked warriors, remained seated on cushioned <i>alga</i>, and
    under the crimson canopy of the state umbrella.</p>

    <p>When night fell, rockets were fired by the royal command,
    "to instil terror into the breasts of the Galla hordes;" and
    the peak which ran near the headquarters, was chosen as the
    most central spot for the display. The effect, brilliant every
    where, was here all that even Majesty could have desired. The
    "fire-rainers" (the picturesqe name which, we presune, Major
    Harris has adopted from the natives) produced delight, wonder,
    and terror, in all their degrees; and if the Galla nation were
    present, they must, to a man, have solicited chains, rather
    than be roasted alive by those flying monsters, which the
    people seem to have taken for the works of magic, if not
    magicians themselves. The display was followed by a repast in
    the old heroic style, and which will not be forgotten, should
    Abyssinia ever give the world a sable Homer.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The chiefs and nobles sat down to their feast in the
        royal pavilion, where hydromel, beer, and <i>raw</i> flesh
        were in regal profusion!! After supper, speeches were made
        in the Homeric style, boasting of what the warriors had
        done, and intended to do. A fragment of one of the
        speeches; addressed to the English as the party broke up,
        gives a fair idea of Abyssinian table eloquence,
        <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285"
           name="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span> 'You are the
           adorners,' (the orator had been decorated with a scarlet
           cloak;) 'you have given me scarlet broadcloth, and
           behold I have reserved the gift for this day. This
           garment will bring me success; for the Pagan who sees a
           crimson cloak on the shoulders of the Amhara,'
           (Abyssinian,) 'believing him to be a warrior of
           distinguished valour, will take, like an ass, to his
           heels, and be speared without the smallest danger.'"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The march, and the foray into the country of one of the
    Galla tribes, are admirably told, and perhaps are among the
    best descriptions in the volumes&mdash;exact without being
    tedious, and deeply coloured without exaggeration. But we must
    hasten to other things. This was the monarch's eighty-fourth
    foray; and on this we may conceive something of the horrors of
    barbarian life, and of the tremendous evils which nations have
    escaped whose laws and principles tame down the original evil
    of man.</p>

    <p>We are glad to find that the embassy refused to take any
    share in this horrible work, though they fell into some
    disrepute with the troops, and even with the monarch, for their
    remissness. The king had even reserved an unlucky Galla in a
    tree, to be shot by his guests. But this they declined, first,
    on the pretext of its being the Sabbath, and next, more
    distinctly on the ground, that&mdash;"no public body was
    authorized by the law of nations, to draw a sword offensively
    in any country not at war with its own." They then offered the
    compromise, "that an elephant was esteemed equivalent to forty
    Gallas, and a wild buffalo to five, and that they were ready to
    shoot as many of both as his Majesty pleased." But the embassy
    did more effectual things; the sick and wounded received relief
    from them to the extent of their means, and they even prevailed
    on the king to liberate all his prisoners. The troops in the
    foray amounted to about 20,000.</p>

    <p>On the return of this destroying expedition, which seems to
    have turned a very fine country into a desert, the king made a
    kind of triumphal entry into his capital. His costume was
    splendidly savage. A lion's skin over his shoulders, richly
    ornamented, and half concealing beneath its folds an
    embroidered green mantle of Indian manufacture; on his right
    shoulder were three chains of gold, as emblems of the Holy
    Trinity,(!) and the fresh-plucked bough of asparagus, which
    denoted his recent exploit, rose from the centre of an embossed
    coronet of silver on his brow. His dappled war-horse, in
    housings of blue and yellow, was led beside him; and in front
    his "champion" rode a coal-black charger, bearing the royal
    shield of massive silver, with the cross upon it, and dressed
    in a panther's hide. The two chief officers of his army rode
    either side of the crimson umbrella; at the palace gates, a
    deputation of priests in white robes received the conqueror
    with a benediction and a volley of musketry announced his
    arrival. The leader of the royal matchlock-men performed a war
    dance before the Ark as it was borne along, and in the inner
    court the principal warriors, each carring some human fragment
    on his lance, flung then on the ground before the royal
    footstool, and shouted their war praise.</p>

    <p>The embassy at length attained personal distinction by the
    death of an elephant, which one of the party brought to the
    ground by a two-ounce ball. The "warriors" were all in
    astonishment at this feat, to which all had predicted the most
    disastrous termiration; and "Boroo, the brave chief of the
    Soopa," exclaimed in his delight, "The world was made for you,
    and no one else has any business in it!"</p>

    <p>The chief object of the embassy was still to be
    accomplished&mdash;the formation of something that approached
    to a treaty of commerce. Beads, cutlery, and trinkets, had been
    received from the coast; but the beggary of the nobles for
    those things was perpetual and intolerable. They called those
    ornanents pleasing things, and the cry was constant, "show me
    pleasing things," "give me delighting things," "adorn me from
    head to foot." It is scarcely surprising that the natives
    should be enamoured of European conmodities; for, though an old
    commerce had subsisted with Arabia, the supplies brought by the
    English were of the most exciting kind. Detonating caps were in
    great request; treble strong canister powder was also
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286"
       name="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span> much in demand. Yet there
       was some ingenuity amongst themselves; for a young fellow
       was taken up for making dollars of pewter. Every spot and
       letter had been closely represented with punch and file.
       "Tell me," said the king, on the case of this culprit being
       mentioned to him, "how is that machine made which in your
       country pours out the silver crowns like a shower of rain?"
       The hand corn-mills, presented by the British Government,
       had been erected within the palace walls, and slaves were
       turning the wheels with unceasing diligence. "Demetrius, the
       Armenian, made a machine to grind corn," exclaimed his
       majesty in a transport of delight, as the flour streamed
       upon the floor; "and though it cost the people a year of
       hard labour to construct, it was useless when finished,
       because the priest declared it to be the devil's work, and
       cursed the bread. But, may the Sahela Selasse
       die&mdash;these engines are the work of clever hands."</p>

    <p>The monarch, elated with his knowledge, now determined to
    build a bridge, which in three days was completed; and, as was
    predicted by the quiet English spectators, in three hours fell
    down on the very first fresh produced by the annual rains.</p>

    <p>Weaving excepted, the people manufactured nothing; but
    British commerce has long been known, though evidently of the
    coarsest kind. At length, on his majesty's being told that five
    thousand looms would bring him more wealth than ten thousand
    soldiers, he gradually consented to form a commercial treaty.
    The crown had hitherto appropriated the property of strangers
    dying in the country. The purchase or display of costly goods
    by the subject had been interdicted, and a maxim exhibiting the
    whole jealousy of savage life had been established, that the
    stranger who once entered was never to depart from Abyssinia.
    By the articles of the commercial treaty, all those barbarous
    prohibitions have been abolished.</p>

    <p>As the monarch returned the deed, he made a short speech
    sufficiently able and appropriate: "You have loaded me with
    costly presents, the rainment that I wear, the throne on which
    I sit, the curiosities in my store-houses, and the muskets
    which hang round my great hall&mdash;all are from your country.
    What have I to give in return for such wealth? My kingdom is as
    nothing."</p>

    <p>The hereditary provinces at this day subject to the King of
    Shoa, are comprised in a rectangular domain of 150 by 90 miles;
    an area traversed by five systems of mountains, of which the
    culminating point divides the basin of the Nile from that of
    the Hawash. The Christian population of Shoa and Efat are
    estimated at a million; and the Moslem and Pagan population at
    a million and a half. The royal revenues are said to amount to
    80,000 or 90,000 German crowns, arising chiefly from import
    duties in slaves, merchandise, and salt. As the annual expenses
    of the state do not exceed 10,000 dollars; it is presumed that
    the king, during his thirty years' reign, has amassed much
    treasure, which is regularly deposited under ground.</p>

    <p>We recommend the enquirers into the truth of Herodotus, to
    examine the curious illustrations stated in these volumes; and,
    among the rest, the kingdom of pigmies. The geographer will
    find ample interest in tracing the course of the Gochob, a sort
    of central Nile; and the naturalist, botanist, and
    entomologist, will find abundant information in the very
    interesting and complete appendices on those subjects. The
    history of the Christian missions of early ages is an excellent
    chapter, and the general statistics of religion.</p>

    <p>The practical religion of the Abyssinian Christian is of the
    very lowest degree of formality. Fasts, penances, and
    excommunications, form the chief discipline; but the penitent
    can always provide a substitute for the two former, and the
    latter is always to be averted by money. Spiritual offences,
    however, are rare; for murder and sacrilege alone give umbrage
    to the easy conscience of the natives of Shoa. Abstinence and
    largesses of money are equivalent to wiping away every sin.
    Their creed advises the invocation of saints, confession to the
    priest, and faith in charms and amulets. Prayers for the dead,
    and absolution, are indispensable; and, as a more summary
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287"
       name="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span> mode of relieving the
       burdens of the flesh, it is pronounced, that all sins are
       forgiven from the moment that the kiss of the pilgrim is
       imprinted on the stones of Jerusalem, and that even kissing
       the hand of a priest purifies the body from all sin. A creed
       of this order, which makes spiritual safety dependent, not
       upon personal purification of mind and divine mercy, but
       upon forms which are unconnected with either, and which even
       can be executed by a substitute, of course excludes the
       necessity for morals of any kind. All is
       corruption&mdash;"Born amid falsehood and deceit, cradled in
       bloodshed, and nursed in the arms of idleness and
       debauchery, the national character almost defies the
       missionary."</p>

    <p>There are some strange remnants of Judaism still lingering
    amongst the tribes of these highland regions. The Galla have a
    tradition, that their whole nation will one day be called on to
    march, <i>en masse</i>, and reconquer Palestine for the return
    of the Jews. The king of Shoa regards himself as a direct
    descendant of the house of Solomon, calls himself king of
    Israel, and the national standard bears the motto, "The Lion of
    the tribe of Judah hath prevailed." They believe the 45th Psalm
    to be a prophecy of Queen Magueda's visit to Jerusalem; whither
    she was attended by a daughter of Hiram, king of Tyre. The
    Jewish prohibitions against the flesh of unclean animals, are
    observed by the Abyssinians. The sinew which shrank, and the
    eating of which was prohibited to the Israelite, is also
    prohibited in Shoa. The Jewish Sabbath is strictly observed.
    The Abyssinians are said, by Ludolf, to be the greatest fasters
    in the world. The Wednesdays and Fridays are fasts; the forty
    days before Easter are rigidly observed as a fast; and from the
    Thursday preceding Easter till the Sunday, no morsel of meat is
    to enter the lips, and the prohibition against drink is equally
    rigorous. St Michael and the Virgin Mary are venerated in the
    highest degree; St Michael as the leader of the hosts of
    heaven, and the latter as the chief of all saints, and queen of
    heaven and earth, and both as the great intercessors of
    mankind.</p>

    <p>Like the Jews of old, the Abyssinians weep and lament on all
    occasions of death; and the shriek ascends to the sky, as if
    the soul could be recalled from the world of spirits. As with
    the Jews, the most inferior garments are employed as the weeds
    of woe; and the skin torn from the temples, and scarified on
    the cheeks and breast, proclaims the last extremity of grief.
    As the Rabbins believe that angels were the governors of all
    sublunary things, the Abyssinians adopt this belief: carrying
    it even further, they confidently implore their assistance in
    all concerns, and invoke and adore them in a higher degree than
    the Creator. The clergy enjoy the price of deathbed confession;
    and the churchyard is sternly denied to all who die without the
    rite, or whose relations refuse the fee and the funeral feast.
    Eight pieces of salt are the price of wafting a poor man's soul
    to the place of rest, and the feast for the dead places him in
    a state of happiness, according to the cost of the
    entertainment. For the rich, money procures the attendance of
    priests, who absolve, and pray continually day and night. The
    anniversaries of the deaths of the six kings of Shoa are held
    with great ceremony in the capital; and once every twelvemonth,
    before a splendid feast, their souls are absolved from all
    sin.</p>

    <p>Major Harris expresses himself ardently and eloquently on
    the hopes of commerce which might be maintained by Great
    Britain with this little-known but productive part of the
    world. It is notorious that gold and gold dust, ivory, ostrich
    feathers, peltries, spices, wax, and precious gums, form a part
    of the lading of every slave caravan; notwithstanding that the
    tediousness of the transport, and the penuriousness of the
    Indian and Arab merchant, offer but a small compensation for
    their labour. No quarter of the globe abounds to a greater
    extent in vegetable and mineral productions than tropical
    Africa; and in the populous, fertile, and salubrious portions
    lying immediately north of the equator, the very highest
    capabilities are presented for the employment of British
    capital. Coal has already been found; cotton, of a quality
    unrivaled in the whole world, is every where a
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288"
       name="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span> weed, and might be
       cultivated to any extent. The coffee which is sold in Arabia
       as the produce of Mocha, is chiefly of wild African growth;
       and that species of the tea plant which is used by the lower
       orders of the Chinese, flourishes so widely, and with so
       little care, that the climate would doubtless be found well
       adapted for the higher-flavoured and more delicate species.
       If, at a very moderate calculation, a sum falling very
       little short of a hundred thousand pounds sterling, can be
       annually invested in European goods, to supply the wants of
       some of the poorer tribes adjacent to Abyssinia, what
       important results might not be anticipated from
       well-directed efforts, adopting the natural neans of
       communication in Africa?</p>

    <p>Another winter passed&mdash;a dreary time for the mission in
    Ankober. Torrents rushed down the mountains, every footpath had
    been converted into a stream, and every valley into a morass.
    The season was peculiarly tempestuous; the heavy white clouds
    constantly hung on the mountain pinnacles, and the torrents
    swelled the Hawash to such an extent, that the land for many
    miles on both sides was inundated. There must have been some
    difficulty in spending the time of this solitary confinement
    among the hills; but the author was well employed in writing
    his volumes, and engineers were employed in erecting a Gothic
    hall, to the great delight of his Abyssinian majesty. He would
    allow them to do every thing except paint his
    portrait&mdash;the national idea being, that whoever takes a
    likeness, immediately becomes invested with power over the
    original. "You are writing a book," he said. "I know this,
    because I never enquire what you are doing that they do not
    tell me you are using a pen, or gazing at the heavens. That is
    a good thing, and it pleases me. You will speak favourably of
    myself; but you shall not insert my portrait, as you have done
    that of the King of Zingero."</p>

    <p>The English had new wonders for him; they shaped planks out
    of trees in a fashion new to the Abyssinians, who waste a tree
    on every plank. "You English are indeed a strange people," said
    the king, as he saw the first plank formed in this economical
    style. "I do not understand your stories of the roads dug under
    rivers, nor of the carriages that gallop without horses; but
    you are a strong people, and employ wonderful inventions."</p>

    <p>At length the Gothic hall was complete. It may be presumed
    that nothing like it was ever seen in Abyssinia before; for the
    mission not merely built, but furnished it with couches,
    ottomans, chairs, tables, and curtains; doubtless a very showy
    affair, though we camot exactly comprehend the author's
    expression of its being furnished after the manner of an
    English cottage ornee. The king, however, was delighted with
    it. "I shall turn it into a chapel," said his majesty, patting
    his chief ecclesiastic on the back. "What say you to that plan,
    my father?" As a last finishing touch, were suspended in the
    centre hall a series of large coloured engravings, representing
    the chase of the tiger in all its various phases. The
    domestication of the elephant, and its employment in war or in
    the pageant, had ever proved a stumbling block to the king; but
    the appearance of the hugest of beasts in his hunting harness
    struck the chord of a new idea. "I will have a nunber caught on
    the Roby," he exclaimed, "that you may tame then, and that I
    too may ride on an elephant before I die!"</p>

    <p>Another of those fearful displays of barbarian plunder and
    havoc took place at the end of September. Twenty thousand
    warriors, headed by the king, made an inroad on the Galla.
    Those unfortunate people were so little prepared, that they
    seem to have been slaughtered without resistance. Between four
    and five thousand were butchered, and forty-three thousand head
    of cattle were driven off. A thousand captives, chiefly women
    and children, were marched in triumph to the capital; but they
    were soon liberated, apparently on the remonstrance of the
    British mission.</p>

    <p>But a terrible disaster was to befall the palace and the
    people. The dweller amongst mountains must be always exposed to
    their dilapidation; and a season of unusual rain, continuing to
    a much later period than usual, produced an
    earth-avalanche.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page289"
           name="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span> "As the evening of an
           eventful night (Dec. 6th) closed in, not a single breath
           of wind disturbed the thick fog which brooded over the
           mountain. A sensible difference was perceptible in the
           atmosphere; but the rain again began to descend, and for
           hours pelted like the dischage of a waterspout. Towards
           morning, a violent thunder storm careered along the
           crest of the range, and every rock and cranny re-echoed
           from the crash of the thunder. Deep darkness again
           settled on the mountains, and a heavy rumbling noise,
           like the passage of artillery wheels, as followed by the
           shrill cry of despair. The earth, saturated with
           moisture, had slidden from their steep slopes, houses
           and cottages were engulfed in the debris, or shattered
           to fragments by the descending masses, and daylight
           presented a strange scene of ruin. Perched on the apex
           of the conical peak, the palace buildings were now
           stripped of their palisades, or overwhelmed: the roads
           along the hill were completely obliterated. The
           desolation had spread for miles along the great range:
           houses, with their inmates, had been hurried away."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Before the mission took its departure, it did honour to the
    character of its country by one act which alone would have been
    worth its time and trouble. The horrid policy of African
    despotism condemns all the brothers of the throne to the
    dungeon, from the moment of the royal accession. The king had
    exhibited qualities of a very unexpected order in an African
    despot, and, under the guidance of the mission, had made some
    advances to justice, and even to clemency. At this period, he
    was suddenly seized with an alarming spasmodic disorder, and he
    apprehended that his constitution, enfeebled by the habits of
    his life, was likely to give way. On his recovery being
    despaired of by both priests and physicians, he suddenly sent
    for the British mission.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"'My children,' said his majesty in a sepulchral voice,
        as he extended his burning hand towards them, 'behold I am
        sore stricken. Last night they believed me dead, and the
        voice of mourning had arisen within the palace walls; but
        God hath spared me until now.'"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It seems to be the custom for the king's physician to taste
    the draught prescribed for him, and an attenpt being made to do
    this by the British, the sick monarch generously forbade
    it.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"'What need is there now of this?' he exclaimed
        reproachfully. 'Do I not know that you would administer to
        Sahela Selasse nothing that could do him mischief?'"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The reader will probably remember an almost similar act of
    confidence of Alexander the Great in his physician. An
    opportunity was now taken of urging him to an act of humanity,
    however strongly opposed to the habits of the country, and to
    the interests of the man. It was represented to him that his
    uncles and brothers had been immured in a dungeon during the
    thirty years of his reign, and that no act could be more
    honourable to himself, or acceptable to Heaven, than the
    extinction of this barbarous custom.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"'And I will release them,' returned the monarch, after
        a moment's debate within himself. 'By the Holy Eucharist I
        swear, and by the Church of the Holy Trinity in Koora
        Gadel, that if Sahela Selasse arise from this bed of
        sickness, all of whom you speak shall be restored to the
        enjoyment of liberty.'"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Fortunately he did arise from that bed of sickness, and he
    honourably determined to keep his promise. The royal captives
    were seven, and the British mission were summoned to see their
    introduction into the presence. They had been so exhausted by
    long captivity, that at first they seemed scarcely to
    comprehend freedom. They had been manacled, and spent their
    time in the fabrication of harps and combs, of which they
    brought specimens to lay at the feet of their monarch. This
    touching interview concluded with a speech of the king to the
    embassy&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"'My children, you will write all that you have seen to
        your country, and will say to the British Queen, that,
        though far behind the nations of the White Men, from whom
        Ethiopia first received her religion, there yet remains a
        spark of Christian love in the breast of the King of
        Shoa.'"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We have thus given a rapid and bird's-eye view of a work,
    which we regard as rivaling in interest and importance any
    "book of travels" of this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290"
       name="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span> century. The name of
       Abyssinia was scarcely more than a recollection, connected
       with the adventurous ramblings of Bruce, for the romantic
       purpose of discovering the source of the Nile. His narrative
       had also been wholly profitless&mdash;attracting public
       curiosity in a remarkable degree at he time, no direct
       foundation of European intercourse was laid, and no movement
       of European traffic followed. But giving Bruce all the
       credit, which was so long denied him, for fidelity to fact,
       and for the spirit of bold adventure which he exhibited in
       penetrating a land of violence and barbarism, the mission of
       Major Harris at once establishes its object on more
       substantial grounds. It is not a private adventure, but a
       public act, rendered natural by the circumstances of British
       neighbourhood, and important for the opening of Abyssinia
       and central Africa to the greatest civilizer which the world
       has ever seen&mdash;the commerce of England. There are still
       obvious difficulties of transit, between the coast and the
       capital, by the ordinary route. But if the navigation of the
       Gochob, or the route from Tajura, should once be secured,
       the trade will have commenced, which in the course of a few
       years will change the face of Abyssinia; limit, if not
       extinguish, that disgrace of human nature&mdash;the slave
       trade; and, if not reform, at least enlighten, the clouded
       Christianity of the people.</p>

    <p>As the author was commissioned, not merely as a discoverer,
    but a diplomatist, it is to be presumed that on many
    interesting points he writes under the restraints of diplomatic
    reserve. But he has told us enough to excite our strong
    interest in the beauty, the fertility, and the capabilities of
    the country which he describes; and more than enough to show,
    that it is almost a British duty to give the aid of our
    science, our inventions, and our principles, to a monarch and a
    people evidently prepared for rising in the scale of
    nations.</p>

    <p>We have a kind of impression, that some general improvement
    is about to take place in the more neglected portions of the
    world, and that England is honoured to be the chief agent in
    the great work. Africa, which has been under a <i>ban</i> for
    so many thousand years, may be on the eve of relief from the
    misery, lawlessness, and impurity of barbarism; and we are
    strongly inclined to look upon this establishment of British
    feeling, and intercourse in Abyssinia, as the commencement of
    that proud and fortunate change. All attempts to enter Africa
    by the western coast have failed. The heat, the swamps, the
    rank vegetation, and the unhealthy atmosphere, have proved
    insurmountable barriers. The north is fenced by a line of
    burning wilderness. But the east is open, free, fertile, and
    beautiful. A British factory in Abyssinia would be not merely a
    source of infinite comfort to the people, by the communication
    of European conveniences and manufactures, but a source of
    light. British example would teach obedience and loyalty to the
    laws, subordination on the part of the people, and mercy on
    that of the sovereign.</p>

    <p>But we have also another object, sufficiently important to
    determine our Government in looking to the increase of our
    connexion with Eastern Africa. It is certainly a minor one, but
    one which no rational Government can undervalue. The policy of
    the present French King is directed eminently to the extension
    of commercial influence in all countries. To this policy, none
    can make objection. It is the duty of a monarch to develop all
    the resources of his country; and while France exerts herself
    only in the rivalry of peace, her advance is an advance of all
    nations. But her extreme attention, of late years, to Africa,
    ought to open our eyes to the necessity of exertion in that
    boundless quarter. On the western coast, she had long fixed a
    lazy grasp; but that grasp is now becoming vigorous, and
    extending hour by hour. Her flag flies at Golam, 250 miles up
    the Senegal. She has a settlement at Gori; she has lately
    established a settlement at the mouth of the Assinee, another
    at the mouth of the Gaboon, and is on the point of establishing
    another in the Bight of Benin; when she will command all
    Western Africa.</p>

    <p>She is not less active on the eastern shore. At Massawah, on
    the coast of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page291"
       name="page291"></a>[pg 291]</span> Abyssinia, she is fast
       monopolizing the trade in gold and spices. She has purchased
       Edh, and is endeavouring to purchase Brava. Her attention to
       <i>Northern</i> Abyssinia is matter of notoriety, and we
       must regard this system, not so much with regard to
       advantages which such possessions might give to ourselves,
       as to their prejudice to us in falling into rival hands. The
       possession of Algeria should direct the eye of Europe to the
       ulterior objects of France; the first change of masters in
       Egypt, must be looked to with national anxiety; and the
       transmission of the great routes of Africa into her hands,
       must be guarded against with a vigilance worthy of the
       interests of England and Europe.</p>

    <p>If the river shall be found navigable to any extent, what an
    opening is thus presented to both the Merchant and the
    philanthropist; a soil surpassed by none in the world, a
    climate varying only 1&ordm; in the mean temperature of summer
    and winter, and presenting an average of 55-1/2&ordm;, and a
    population who could hardly fail to feel the advantages of
    commerce and civilization. From such a point as Aden offers,
    access is promised to the very heart of Africa, and thence to
    the sources of the mighty rivers which find an outlet on the
    western side of the continent; thus not merely benefiting the
    British merchant in a remarkable degree, but rapidly abolishing
    the slave trade, by giving employment to the people, wealth to
    the native trader, and a new direction to the powers of the
    country and the mind of its unhappy population.</p>

    <p>On the whole consideration of the subject, we feel
    convinced, that Eastern Africa is the safe and the natural
    point for British enterprise; that it is the most direct and
    effective point for the extinction of the cruel traffic in
    human flesh; and that it is the most promising and productive
    point for the establishment of that substantial connexion with
    the governments of the interior, which alone can be regarded as
    worth the attention of the statesman.</p>

    <p>Insignificant stations on the coast, to carry on a peddling
    traffic, are beneath a manly and comprehensive policy. We must
    penetrate the mountains, ascend the rivers, and reach the seats
    of sovereignty. We must, by a large and generous self-interest,
    combine the good, the knowledge, and the virtue of the
    population with our own; and we must lay the foundation of our
    permanent influence over this fourth of the globe, by showing
    that we are the fittest to communicate the benefits, and
    establish the example of civilized society.</p>

    <p>To those who desire to go into more minute details, we
    recommend an accompanying volume by the missionaries Isenberg
    and Krapf&mdash;the latter of whom acted as interpreter to the
    embassy. A capital geographical memoir is also given by Mr
    M'Queen, the well-known African geographer.</p>

    <p>On the whole, it is highly gratifying to our respect for
    British soldiership; to see works of this rank proceeding from
    our military men. They have great opportunities, and may thus
    render national services in peace, not less important than
    their enterprise in war. The East India Company offers
    inducements of the most important order, to the accomplishment
    and scientific activity of its officers; and Major Harris must
    feel the distinction of having been selected for a mission of
    such interest, as well as the high gratification of having
    conducted it to so benevolent, solid, and satisfactory a
    close.</p>

    <h2>A WORD OR TWO OF THE OPERA-TIVE CLASSES.</h2>

    <h3>BY LORGNON.</h3>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i6">"Vai, ch'avete gl'intelletti sani,</p>

            <p>Mirate la dottrina che s'asconde,</p>

            <p>Sotto queste coperte, alte e
            profonde!"&mdash;BERNI.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In the course of social transition, professions, like dogs,
    have their day. A calling honourable in one century, becomes
    infamous in the next; and vocations grow obsolete, like the
    fashioning of our garments or figures of speech. In barbarous
    communities, the strong man is king:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Le premier roi fut un soldat heureux."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Where human statute is beginning to prize the general weal,
    the legist is of high account, and the priest paramount. Higher
    civilization engenders the influence of the man of letters, the
    artist, the dramatist, the wit, the poet, and the orator. Or
    when, with a wisdom surpassing the philosophy of the schools,
    we tumble down to prose, and assume the leathern apron of the
    utilitarian&mdash;the civil engineer, or operative chemist,
    starts up into a colossus. Sir Humphrey Davy, and Sir Isambert
    Brunel, are the true knights of modern chivalry; and Sir
    Walter&mdash;our Sir Walter&mdash;never showed himself more
    shrewd than in his exclamation to Moore&mdash;"Ah,
    Tam!&mdash;it's lucky, man, we cam' sae soon!" Great as was his
    influence, equaling that of the other two great Sir Walters,
    Manny and Raleigh, in their several epochs of valour and
    enterprise, it is likely enough, that, if born a century later,
    the MSS. of the Scotch novels would have been chiefly valuable
    to light the furnace of some factory!</p>

    <p>So much in exposition of the fact, that, so long as the
    world possessed only three of what we choose to call quarters,
    an executioner was an officer of state; and that, now it
    possesses five, the female of highest renown, and greatest
    power of self-enrichment, is the <i>danseuse</i>, or
    opera-dancer!</p>

    <p>Many intermediary callings have disappeared. The domestic
    chaplain of a lordly household is now nearly as superfluous as
    its archers or falconers; and the court calendars of former
    reigns record a variety of places and perquisites, which, did
    they still exist, would be unpalatable to modern courtiers,
    though compelled to earn their daily cakes, however dirty. Just
    as the last golden pippin of the house of Crenie was preserved
    in wax for the edification of posterity, a watchman has been
    deposited, with his staff and lantern, in the Royal Arsenal at
    Woolwich, or the Museum of the Zoological, or United Service
    Club, or some other of your grand national collections, as a
    specimen of the extinct Dogberry or Charley of the eighteenth
    century; and in process of time, as much and more also will
    probably be done to a parish beadle, a theatrical manager, a
    lord chamberlain&mdash;and other public functionaries whom it
    might not be altogether safe to enumerate.</p>

    <p>Among them, however, there is really some satisfaction in
    hinting at the hangman!&mdash;For, hear it, ye sanguinary
    <i>manes</i> of our ancestors:&mdash;"<i>Les bourreaux s'en
    vont!</i>" Executioners are departing! We shall shortly have to
    commemorate in our obituaries, and signalize by the hands of
    our novelists&mdash;"the last of the Jack Ketches." In these
    days of ultra-philanthropy, the hangman scarcely finds salt to
    his porridge, or porridge to salt.</p>

    <p><i>Exempli gratia</i>. In the course of last year, a patient
    of the lower class was admitted into the lunatic ward of the
    public hospital at Marseilles, whose malady seemed the result
    of religious depression. In that supposition, the usual means
    of relief were resorted to, and he was at length discharged as
    convalescent; when, to attest the perfectness of his cure, he
    went and hanged himself! A <i>proc&egrave;s verbal</i> was, as
    usual, made out, and the supposed fanatic proved to be the
    ex-executioner of Lyons! Tender-hearted people instantly
    ascribed his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293"
       name="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span> melancholy to qualms of
       conscience. But it appeared in evidence, that, since the
       accession of the citizen king, the trade of the hangman had
       become a dead failure; and the disconsolate bankrupt was
       accordingly forced to take French leave of a world wherein
       <i>bourreaux</i> can no longer turn an honest penny!</p>

    <p>Yet, less than three centuries ago, his predecessors were
    men of mark and consideration. Our own King Hal took more heed
    of his executioner than of half the counties over whose necks
    his axe was suspended; while Louis XI., a <i>legitimate</i>
    sovereign of France, used to dip in the dish with Tristan
    Hermite and Olivier le Dain. A few reigns later, and the
    hangman of the French metropolis (who shares with its diocesan
    the honour of being styled "Monsieur de Paris") was respected
    as the most accomplished in Europe. The treasons of its civil
    wars had created so many executions, that a Gascon, wishing to
    prove that his father had been beheaded as a nobleman, instead
    of hanged like a dog or a citizen, asserted the decollation to
    have been so expertly executed <i>en Gr&egrave;ve</i>, that the
    sufferer was unconscious of his end. "Shake yourself,"
    exclaimed the executioner; and, on his lordship's making the
    attempt, his head rolled into the dust.</p>

    <p>This adroitness was the result of competition. In that day
    there were degrees of hangmen, and promotion might be
    accomplished. Not only had the king his executioner, and the
    Lorraines theirs&mdash;the court and the city&mdash;the abbot
    of St Germain des Pr&egrave;s&mdash;the abbot of this, and the
    abbot of that&mdash;but various communities and Signories,
    having right of life and death over their vassals, kept an
    executioner for purposes of domestic torture, as they kept a
    seneschal to carve their meats; or as people now keep a
    <i>chef</i> or a <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>. In those
    excellent olden times of Europe, hangmen, doubtless, carried
    about written characters from lord to lord, certifying their
    experience with rope and axe&mdash;branding-iron and thong. So
    long as the Inquisition afforded constant work for able hands,
    a good hangman out of place must have been a treasure! Had
    there been register-offices or newspaper advertisements, there
    probably would have appeared&mdash;</p>

    <p>"WANTS A SITUATION&mdash;An able-bodied, middle-aged man,
    without encumbrance, who can have an undeniable character from
    his last situation, as headsman, hangman, and general
    executioner. He is accustomed to the use of thumbikins and the
    most approved and fashionable modes of torture; and officiated
    for many years as superintendent of the wheel of a foreign
    prince, renowned for the neatness of his rack. Drawing and
    quartering in all their branches. Pressing to death performed
    in the most economical style. Impalement in the Turkish manner;
    and the pile, as practised by the best Smithfield hands,
    &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

    <p>Independent, indeed, of the high prosperity and vast
    perquisites of such posts as executioner of the Tower of London
    or the Gr&egrave;ve of Paris, there was honour and satisfaction
    in the office. A royal master knew when he was well served.
    Henry III. stood by, in his chateau of Blois, to see, not only
    the heads severed from the dead bodies of the Duke and Cardinal
    de Guise, but their <i>flesh cut into small pieces</i>,
    preparatory to being burned, and the ashes scattered to the
    winds. "His majesty," says an eyewitness, "stood in a pool of
    blood to witness the hacking of the bodies."</p>

    <p>This Italian <i>gusto</i> for the smell of blood, appears to
    have been introduced into the palaces of France from those of
    Italy by alliance with the Medici&mdash;those ennobled
    pawnbrokers of the middle ages, whose <i>parvenu</i> taste
    engendered the fantastic gilding of the <i>renaissance</i>,
    which they naturalized in the Tuileries and at Fontainbleau, in
    common with the stiletto and acqua tofana of their poisoners,
    and the fatalism of their judicial astrology.</p>

    <p>But enough of Catharine de Medicis and her sanguinary
    son&mdash;enough of Henry Tudor and his savage
    daughters&mdash;enough of the monstrous professions flourishing
    in their age of monstrosities. And turn we for relief to the
    exquisite vocation completing the antithesis&mdash;the vocation
    whose execution is that of <i>pas de z&eacute;phyrs</i>, and
    the tortures of whose <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294"
       name="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span> infliction are the
       tortures of the tender heart!</p>

    <p>The calling of the <i>danseuse</i>, we repeat, is among the
    most lucrative of modern times, and nearly the most
    influential. The names of Taglioni and Elssler are as European,
    nay, as universal, as those of Wellington and
    Talleyrand-Metternich or Thiers; and modern statesmanship and
    modern diplomacy show pale beside the Machiavelism of the
    <i>coulisses</i>.</p>

    <p>With what pomp of phraseology are the triumphs and movements
    of these <i>danseuses</i> announced, by the self-same journal
    which despatches, with a stroke of the pen, the submission of a
    province or revolution of a kingdom! One poor halfpenny-worth,
    or half a line, suffices for the death of a sultana; while
    fiery columns precede the departure and arrival of the steamer
    honoured by conveying across the Atlantic some ethereal being,
    whose light fantastic toe is to give the law to the United
    States. Her appearance in the Ecclesiastic States, on the other
    hand, is announced in Roman capitals; and her triumphal entry
    into St Petersburg received with regiments of notes of
    admiration!!!</p>

    <p>Were Taglioni, by the malediction of Providence, to break
    her leg, what corner of the civilized earth but would
    sympathize in the casualty? Or were Elssler epidemically
    carried off, on the same day with the Pope, the Archbishop of
    Dublin, a chancellor of an university, an historiographer, or
    astronomer-royal&mdash;<i>which</i> would be most cared for by
    society at large, or to which would the public journals
    distribute the larger share of their dolefuls?</p>

    <p>Nor is it alone the levities of Europe which have
    encompassed with a gaseous atmosphere of enthusiasm these idols
    of the day. We appeal to our sober, plodding, painstaking
    brother Jonathan. We move for returns of the sums he has
    expended on his beloved Fanny, and for notes of the honours
    conferred upon her, not only on the boards of his theatres and
    in the publicity of his causeways, but amid the august
    nationalities of his senate! "Fanny Elssler in Congress" has
    become as historical as the name of Washington! As if for the
    purpose of proving that extremes meet, the democrats of the New
    World were demonstrating the wildest infatuation in favour of
    one dancer, while the great autocrat of the Old was exhibiting
    a similar fervour in honour of another. La Gitana became all
    but presidentess of the Transatlantic republic; La
    Bayad&egrave;re depolarized the tyrant of the Poles! But, above
    all, the Empress of Russia&mdash;albeit, the lightest of
    sovereigns and coldest of women&mdash;was carried so far by her
    enthusiasm as to fasten a bracelet of gems on the fair arm of
    Taglioni; while the Queen-Dowager of England conferred a
    similar honour on the Neapolitan dancer Cerito!</p>

    <p>Now, what queen or princess, we should like to know, has
    lavished necklace, or bracelet, or one poor pitiful brooch, on
    Miss Edgeworth or Miss Aitkin, Mrs Somerville or Joanna
    Baillie, or any other of the female illustrations of the age,
    saving these aerial machines which have achieved such enviable
    supremacy? Mrs Marcet, who has taught the young idea of our
    three kingdoms how to shoot; Miss Martineau, who has engrafted
    new ones on our oldest crab-stocks, might travel from Dan to
    Beersheba without having a fatted calf or a fatted capon killed
    for them, at the public expense. But let Taglioni take the
    road, and what clapping of hands&mdash;what
    gratulation&mdash;what curiosity&mdash;what expansion of
    delight!</p>

    <p>The only wonder of all this is, that we should wonder about
    the matter. Dancing constitutes that desideratum of the learned
    of all ages&mdash;an universal language. Music, which many
    esteem much, is nearly as nationalized in its rhythm as dialect
    in its words; whereas the organs of sight are cosmopolitan. The
    eye of man and the foot of the dancer include between them all
    nations and languages. The poetry of motion is interpreted by
    the lexicon of instinct; and the unimpregnable grace of a
    Taglioni becomes omnipotent and catholic as that of</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The statue that enchants the world!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Who can doubt that the names of these sorceresses of our
    time will reach posterity, as those of the Aspasias and Lauras
    of antiquity have reached our own&mdash;as having held
    philosophers by the beard, and trampled on the necks
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295"
       name="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span> of the conquerors of
       mankind&mdash;as being those for whom Solon legislated, and
       to whom Pericles succumbed?</p>

    <p>Pausanius tells us of the stately tomb of the frail
    Pythonice in the Vica Sacra; and we know that Phryne offered to
    rebuild the walls of Thebes, by Alexander overthrown. And
    surely, if modern guide-books instruct us to weep in the
    cemetery of P&egrave;re la Chaise over the grave of Fanny Bias,
    history will say a word or two in honour of Cerito, who
    proposed through the newspapers, last season, an alliance
    offensive and defensive with no less a man than Peter
    Borthwick, Esq. M.P., (<i>Arcades ambo</i>!) to relieve the
    distress of the manufacturing classes of Great Britain! It is
    true such heroines can afford to be generous; for what lord
    chancellor or archbishop of modern times commands a revenue
    half as considerable?</p>

    <p>Why, therefore&mdash;O Public! why, we beseech thee, seeing
    that the influence of the operative class is fairly understood,
    and undeniably established among us&mdash;why not at once
    elevate choriography to the rank of one of the fine
    arts?&mdash;Why not concentrate, define, and qualify the
    calling, by a public academy?&mdash;since all hearts and eyes
    are amenable to the charm of exquisite dancing, why vex
    ourselves by the sight of what is bad, when better may be
    achieved? Be wise, O Pubic, and consider! Establish a
    professor's chair for the improvement of pirouetters. We have
    hundreds of professor's chairs, quite as unavailable to the
    advancement of the interests of humanity, and wholly
    unavailable to its pleasures. Neither painters nor musicians
    acquire as much popularity as dancers, or amass an equal
    fortune. Why should they be more highly protected by the
    state?</p>

    <p>To disdain this exquisite art, is a proof of barbarism. The
    nations of the East may cause their dances to be performed by
    slaves; but two of the greatest kings of ancient and modern
    times, the kings after God's own heart and man's own
    heart&mdash;David and Louis le Grand&mdash;were excellent
    dancers, the one before the ark, the other before his
    subjects.</p>

    <p>Never, perhaps, did the art of dancing attain such eminent
    honours in the eyes of mankind, as during the <i>si&egrave;cle
    dor&eacute;</i> of the latter monarch. At an epoch boasting of
    Moli&egrave;re and Racine, Bossuet and F&eacute;n&eacute;lon,
    Boileau and La Fontaine, Colbert and Perrault, (the fairy
    talisman of politics and architecture,) the court of Versailles
    could imagine no manifestation of regality more august, or more
    exquisite, than that of getting up a royal ballet; and the
    father of his people, Louis XIV., was, in his youth, its
    <i>coulon</i>.</p>

    <p>How amusing are the descriptions of these <i>entr&eacute;es
    de ballet</i>, circumstantially bequeathed us by the memoirs of
    the regency of Anne of Austria! The cardinal himself took part
    in them; but the chief performers were the young King, his
    brother Gaston d'Orleans, and the maids of honour, figuring as
    Apollo and the Muses, or Hamadryads adoring some sylvan
    divinity. Who has not sympathized in the joy of Madame de
    Sevign&eacute;, at seeing her fair daughter exhibit among the
    <i>coryph&eacute;es</i>! Who has not felt interested in the
    <i>jet&eacute;es</i> and <i>pas de bourr&eacute;es</i> of the
    <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, when accomplished at court by
    Cond&eacute;s, Contis, Montpensiers, Montmorencys, Rohans,
    Guises! The Marquis de Dangeau first recommended himself to the
    favour of the royal master whose courts he was destined to
    journalize for posterity, by the skill of his <i>pas de
    basques</i>; and long before the all but conjugal influence of
    the lovely La Valli&egrave;re commenced over the heart of the
    <i>grand monarque</i>, his early love, and more especially his
    passion for the beautiful niece of the Cardinal, may be traced
    to the rehearsals and <i>rondes de jambes</i> of Maitz and
    Fontainbleau.</p>

    <p>The reign of Madame de Maintenon (<i>la raison
    m&ecirc;me</i>) over his affections, declared itself by the
    sudden transfer of a ballet-opera, expressly composed by Rameau
    and Quinault for the beauties of the court, to the public
    theatre of the Palais Royal. No more noble figurantes at
    Versailles! Louis le Pirouettiste's occupation was gone; and
    the <i>ma&icirc;tre des ballets du roi</i> arrayed himself in
    sackcloth and ashes. But, lo! the glories of his throne took
    wing with the loves and graces; ballets and victories being
    effaced on the same page from the annals of his reign.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page296"
       name="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span> During the minority of
       Louis XV., the same royal dansomania was renewed. The
       regent, Duke of Orleans, entertained the same notions of
       kingly education, on this head, as his predecessor the
       cardinal; and Louis <i>le Bien-aim&eacute;</i>, like his
       great-grandfather before him, was the best dancer of his
       realm. Such dancing as it was! such exquisite footing! In
       the upper story of the grand gallery at Versailles, hang
       several pictures representing these court ballets; Cupids in
       coatees of pink lustring, with silver lace and tinsel wings,
       wearing full-bottomed wigs and the riband of the St Esprit;
       or Venuses in hoops and powder, whose <i>minauderies</i>
       might afford a lesson to the divinities of our own day for
       the benefit of the omnibus box.</p>

    <p>Some of these groups, by Mignard, Boucher, and their
    imitators, are charming studies as <i>tableaux de genre</i>.
    But in nothing, by the way, are they more remarkable than in
    their <i>decency</i>. The nudities of the present times appear
    to have been undreamed of in the philosophy of Versailles. That
    simple-hearted, though strong-minded American writer, Miss
    Sedgwick, who has published an account of her consternation as
    she sat with Mrs Jameson in the stalls of our Italian opera,
    might have witnessed the royal performance unabashed. On being
    told, as she gazed upon the intrepid self-exposure of Taglioni,
    "<i>qu'il fallait &ecirc;tre sage pour danser comme
    &ccedil;a</i>," Miss S. observes, that it requires to be more
    or less than woman, and proposes to divide the human species
    into men, women, and OPERA-DANCERS, little suspecting that half
    her readers translate such a classification into "men, women,
    and ANGELS;" or that they would see herself and her sister
    moralist go down in the <i>President</i> without a pang,
    provided Elssler and Taglioni were saved from the deep!</p>

    <p>Natural enough! we repeat it&mdash;natural enough! To create
    a good dancer, requires the rarest combination of physical and
    mental endowments. Graceful as the forms transmitted to us by
    the pottery of Etruria and the frescoes of Herculaneum, she
    must unite with the strength of an athlete, the genius of a
    first-rate actress. That even moderate dancing demands
    immoderate abilities, is attested by the exhibition of human
    ungainliness disfiguring all the court balls of Europe. There
    may be seen the representatives of the highest nobility,
    tutored by the highest education, shuffling over the polished
    floor with stiffened arms and bewildered legs&mdash;often out
    of time&mdash;always out of place&mdash;as if acting under the
    influence of a galvanic battery. Not one in ten of them rises
    even to mediocrity as a dancer. A few degrees lower in the
    social scale, and it would be not one in twenty. Amid the
    shoving, shouldering, shuffling mob of dancers in an ordinary
    ball-room, the absence of all grace amounts even to the
    ludicrous. Forty years long have people been dancing the
    quadrilles now in vogue, which consist of six favourite
    country-dances, fashionable in Paris at the close of the last
    century, and then singly known by the names they still
    retain&mdash;"La Poule, L'Et&eacute;, Le Pantalon, Le Trenis,"
    &amp;c. &amp;c. To avoid the monotony of dancing each in
    succession, for hours at a time, down a file of forty couple,
    it was arranged that every eight couple should form a square,
    and perform the favourite dances, in succession, with the same
    partner&mdash;a considerable relief to the monotony of the
    ball-room. Yet, after all this experience, if poor Monsieur le
    Trenis (after whom one of the figures was named, and who,
    during the consulate, died dancing-mad in a public lunatic
    asylum) could rise, sane, from the dead, it would be enough to
    drive him mad again to see how little had been acquired, in the
    way of practice, since his decease. The processes and varieties
    of the ball-room are just where he left then on his exit!</p>

    <p>Previous to the introduction of quadrilles and country
    dances or <i>contredanses</i>, the inaptitude of nine-tenths of
    mankind for dancing was still more eminently demonstrated in
    the murders of the minuet. For (as Morall, the dancing-master
    of Marie Antoinette, used passionately to exclaim)&mdash;<i>que
    de choses dans un minuet</i>! What worlds of modest
    dignity&mdash;of alternate amenity and scorn! The minuet has
    all the tender coquetry of the bolero, divested of its
    licentious fervour. With the <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page297"
       name="page297"></a>[pg 297]</span> minuet and the hoop,
       indeed, disappeared that powerful circumvallation of female
       virtue, rendering superfluous the annual publication of a
       dozen codes of ethics, addressed to the "wives of England"
       and their daughters. All was comprehended in the <i>pas
       grave</i>. That noble and right Aulic dance was expressly
       invented in deference to the precariousness of powdered
       heads; and its calm sobrieties, once banished from the
       ball-room, revolutionary <i>boulang&egrave;res</i>
       succeeded&mdash;and chaos was come again! The stately
       <i>pavon</i> had possession of the English court, with ruffs
       and farthingales, in the reign of Elizabeth. With the
       Stuarts came the wild courante or corante&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Hair loosely flowing, robes as free"&mdash;</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and if the House of Hanover, and minuets, reformed for a
    time the irregularities of St James's&mdash;what are we to
    expect now that waltzes, galops, and the eccentricities of the
    cotillon have possession of the social stage? WHAT NEXT? as the
    pamphlets say&mdash;"What will the lords do?"&mdash;what the
    ladies?</p>

    <p>Thus much in proof, that the boss of pirouettiveness is
    strangely wanting in human conformation, and that there is
    consequently all the excuse of ignorance for the wild
    enthusiasm lavished by London on the operative class. Ten
    guineas per night&mdash;five hundred for the season&mdash;is
    the price exacted for a first-rate opera-box; and as the
    exclusives usually arrive at the close of the opera, or, if
    earlier, keep up a perpetual babble during its performance,
    they clearly come for the dancing.&mdash;"<i>On voit
    l'op&eacute;ra, et l'on &eacute;coute le ballet</i>," used to
    be said of the Acad&eacute;mie de Musique. But it might be
    asserted now, with fully as much truth, of the Queen's Theatre,
    where the evolutions of Carlotta Grisi, Elssler, and Cerito,
    keep the audience in a state of breathless attention denied to
    Shakspeare.</p>

    <p>In two out of these instances, it may be advanced that they
    are consummate actresses as well as graceful and active
    dancers. Elssler's comedy is almost as piquant as that of
    Mademoiselle Mars. Nor is the ballet unsusceptible of a still
    higher order of histrionic display. We never remember to have
    seen a stronger <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i> of cambric
    handkerchiefs in honour of O'Neill's <i>Mrs Haller</i>, or
    Siddons's <i>Isabella</i>, than of the ballet of "Nina;" while
    the affecting death-dance in "Masaniello" is still fresh in the
    memory of the admirers of Pauline Leroux. We have heard of
    swoons and hysterics along the more impressionable audiences of
    La Scala, during the performance of the ballet of "La Vestale;"
    and have witnessed with admiration the striking effect of the
    fascinative scene in "Faust."</p>

    <p>Of late years, the union of Italian blood and a French
    education has been found indispensable to create a
    <i>danseuse</i>&mdash;"Sangue Napolitano in scuola
    Parigiana;"&mdash;and Vesuvius is the Olympus of all our recent
    divinities. Formerly, a Spanish origin was the most successful.
    The first dancer who possessed herself of European notoriety
    was La Camargo, whose portraits, at the close of a century, are
    still popular in France, where she has been made the heroine of
    several recent dramas. To her reign, succeeded that of the
    Gruinards and Duth&eacute;s&mdash;in honour of whose bright
    eyes, a variety of noblemen saw the inside both of Fort St
    Ev&ecirc;que and St Pelagie; the opera being at that time a
    fertile source of <i>lettres de cachet</i>. To obtain
    admittance to the private theatricals of the former dancer, in
    her magnificent hotel in the Chauss&eacute;e d'Antin, the
    ladies of fashion and of the court had recourse to the meanest
    artifices; while the latter has obtained historical renown, by
    having excited the jealousy, or rather envy, of Marie
    Antoinette. Mademoiselle Duth&eacute; appeared at the
    f&ecirc;tes of Longchamps, in the Bois de Boulogne, in a
    gorgeous chariot drawn by six milk-white steeds, with red
    morocco harness, richly ornamented with cut steel; and thus
    accomplished the object of incurring the resentment of the
    court, from the prodigality of one of whose married princes
    these splendours were supposed to emanate&mdash;splendours
    exceeding those of the Rhodopes of old.</p>

    <p>But the greatest triumph ever achieved by <i>danseuse</i>,
    was that of Bigottini! The Allied sovereigns, after vanquishing
    the victor of modern Europe, were by <i>her</i> vanquished in
    their turn. At <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298"
       name="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span> her feet, fresh trembling
       from an <i>entre-chat</i>, did</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Fiery French and furious Hun"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>lay down their arms! The Allied armies appeared to have
    entered Paris only to become the slaves of Bigottini!</p>

    <p>In our own country, devotees of the <i>danseuse</i> have
    done more, by promoting her to the decencies of the domestic
    fireside. In our own country, also, even Punch was once
    purchased by an eccentric nobleman for the diversion of his
    private life. But as Demosthenes observed of the cost of such a
    pleasure, "that is buying repentance too dear!"</p>

    <p>We are perhaps offending the gravity of certain of our
    readers by the extent of this notice; albeit, we have striven
    to propitiate their prejudices by the peculiar combination and
    juxtaposition of professions, selected for consideration. But
    we are not acting unadvisedly. Close its eyes as it may, the
    public cannot but perceive, that the legitimate drama is
    banished by want of encouragement from the national theatres,
    and that the ballet is brandishing her cap and bells
    triumphantly in its room.</p>

    <p>Such changes are never the result of accident. The supply is
    created by the demand. It is because we prefer the Sylphide to
    Juliet, that the Sylphide figures before us. Shakspeare was
    played to empty benches; the Peri and Gisele fill the
    houses.</p>

    <p>We repeat, therefore, since such is the bent of public
    appetite, let it be gratified in the least objectionable way.
    Let us have a royal academy of dancing. We shall easily find
    some Earl of Westmoreland to compose its ballets, and lady
    patronesses to give an annual ball for the benefit of the
    institution. Do not let some eighty thousand a-year be lost to
    the country. An idol is as easily carved out of one block of
    wood as another. Let us make unto ourselves goddesses out of
    the haberdashers' shops of Oxford Street; and qualify the
    youthful caprices of Whitechapel to command the homage of
    Congress, and of the great autocrat of all the Russias.
    Properly instructed, little Sukey Smith may still obtain an
    enameled brooch or bracelet from her Majesty the Queen-Dowager!
    Let us "people this whole isle with sylphs!" Let Drury-Lane and
    Covent-Garden flourish; but&mdash;thanks to Great Britain
    pirouettes!&mdash;the art of giving ten guineas for a couple of
    hours spent in an opera-box, will then become less criminal;
    and we shall have no fear of the influence of some Herodias's
    daughter in our domestic life, when we see the Cracovienne
    announced in the bills "by Miss Mary Thomson." The charm will
    be destroyed. The unfrequented <i>coulisses</i>, like Dodona,
    will cease to give forth oracles.</p>

    <p>Under the influence of an "establishment," we shall have to
    record of opera-dancers as of other professions, that "the
    goddesses are departing!" The <i>danse &agrave; roulades</i> of
    Fanny Elssler will be voted vulgar, when attempted by a
    Buggins. Let Mr Bunn look to himself. He may yet survive his
    immortality. We foresee a day in which he will be no longer
    styled Alfred the Great. With the aid of George Robins, and
    other illustrious persons interested in the destinies of
    theatrical property, we do not despond of hearing attached to
    "a bill for the legalization of the Royal and National Academy
    of Dancing of the United Kingdom," the satisfactory decree of
    "LA REINE LE VEUT!"</p>

    <h2>THE PIRATES OF SEGNA.</h2>

    <h3>A TALE OF VENICE AND THE ADRIATIC. IN TWO PARTS.</h3>

    <h3>PART I.</h3>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE STUDIO.</h4>

    <p>It was on a bright afternoon in spring, and very near the
    close of the sixteenth century, that a handsome youth, of
    slender form and patrician aspect, was seated and drawing
    before an easel in the studio of the aged cavaliere Giovanni
    Contarini&mdash;the last able and distinguished painter of the
    long-declining school of Titian. The studio was a spacious and
    lofty saloon, commanding a cheerful view over the grand canal.
    Full curtains of crimson damask partially shrouded the lofty
    windows, intercepting the superabundant light, and diffusing
    tints resembling the ruddy, soft, and melancholy hues of
    autumnal foliage; while these hues were further deepened by a
    richly carved ceiling of ebony, which, not reflecting but
    absorbing light, allayed the sunny radiance beneath, and
    imparted a sombre yet brilliant effect to the pictured walls,
    and glossy draperies, of the spacious apartment. Above the rich
    and lofty mantelpiece hung one of the last portraits of himself
    painted by the venerable Titian, and on the dark pannels around
    were suspended portraits of great men and lovely women by the
    gifted hands of Giorgione, Paul Veronese, Paris Bordone, and
    Tintoretto. Regardless, however, of all around him, and almost
    breathless with eagerness and impatience, the student pursued
    his object, and with rapid and vigorous strokes had half
    completed his sketch&mdash;totally unconcious the while that
    some one had opened the folding-doors, crossed the saloon, and
    now stood behind his chair.</p>

    <p>"But tell me, Antonello mio!" exclaimed old Contarini, after
    gazing awhile in mute astonishment at the sketch before him;
    "tell me, in the name of wonder, what kind of face do you mean
    to draw around that lean and withered nose and that horribly
    wrinkled mouth?"</p>

    <p>Antonio, however, was so unconcious of the "world without,"
    that he started not at this sudden interruption of the previous
    stillness. Regardless, too, of the serious and indeed reproving
    tone of the old man's voice, he hastily replied without
    averting his gaze from the canvass. "Hush, maestro! I beseech
    you. Question me not, for Heaven's sake! I cannot spare a word
    in reply. The original," continued he, after a brief interval
    of close attention to his object, and drawing as he spoke; "the
    original is still firmly fixed in my memory. I see its sharp
    outlines clear within me, and, as you well know and oft have
    told me, a feature lost is lost for ever. Alas! alas! those
    lines and angles around the mouth are already fading into
    shadow."</p>

    <p>After he had thrown out these words, from time to time, like
    interjections, and with Venetian rapidity of utterance, nothing
    was audible in the saloon for some minutes but the young
    artist's sharp and rapid strokes upon the canvass.</p>

    <p>"No more of this, Antonio!" at length exclaimed the old
    painter with energy, after gazing for some time at the gradual
    appearance of an old woman's lean and winkled features, dried
    up and yellow as if one of the dead, and yet lighted up by a
    pair of dark deep-set eyes, which seemed to blaze with
    supernatural life and lustre. At each touch of the artist, this
    mummy-like and unearthly visage was brought out into sharper
    and more disgusting relief, when Contarini, no longer able to
    control his indignation, dashed the charcoal from his pupil's
    hand. "Apage, Satanas!" he shouted, "thy talent hath a devil in
    it. I see his very hoof-print in that horrible design."</p>

    <p>Startled by this unexpected violence, the young artist
    turned round, and beheld with amazement the usually benign
    featutes of his venerable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300"
       name="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span> teacher flashing upon him
       with irrepressible anger, which was the more impressive
       because the Cavaliere had just returned from a visit to the
       Doge, and was richly attired in the imposing patrician
       costume of the period. Around his neck was the golden chain
       hung there by the imperial hands of Rodolph the Second, and
       he wore the richly enameled barret, and lofty heron's plume,
       which the same picture-loving emperor had placed upon his
       head when he knighted him as a reward for the noble pictures
       he had painted in Germany. There was a true and fine air of
       nobility in his lofty form and well-marked features&mdash;a
       character of matured thought and intellectual power in the
       expansive brow, and in the firm gaze of his large dark eyes,
       as yet undimmed by age&mdash;with evidence of decision and
       self-respect, and habitual composure in the finely formed
       mouth and chin. Thus splendidly arrayed, and thus dignified
       in form, features, and expression, this distinguished man
       recalled so powerfully to the memory of his imaginative
       pupil the high-minded doges of the heroic period of Venice,
       and the imposing portraits of Titian's senators, that, with
       a deep sense of his own moral inferiority, he obeyed in
       silence, and with starting tears removed the offending
       sketch. Then placing before him a small picture of a weeping
       and lovely Magdalen by Contarini, which he had undertaken to
       copy, he began the sketch, patiently awaiting a voluntary
       explanation of this unwonted vehemence in his beloved
       teacher, who, seated in his armchair, leaned his head upon
       his hand and seemed lost in thought.</p>

    <p>And now again for some time was the deep stillness of the
    studio interrupted only by the strokes of Antonio's charcoal,
    which, unlike his rapid and feverish efforts when sketching the
    old woman, were now subdued and tranquil. As he gazed into the
    upraised and pleading eyes of the beautiful Magdalen, his
    excitement gradually yielded to the pacifying influence of her
    mute and eloquent sorrow. This salutary change escaped not the
    observation of Contarini, whose benevolent features softened as
    he gazed upon these tokens of a better spirit in his pupil.</p>

    <p>"I rejoice to see, Antonio," he began, "that you already
    feel, how ever imperfectly, the soothing and hallowed influence
    of the Beautiful in Art and Nature, and the peril to soul and
    body of delighting in imaginary forms of horror. If you indulge
    these cravings of a distempered fancy, you will sink to the
    base level of those Flemish artists who delight in painting
    witches and demons, and in all fabulous and monstrous forms.
    You, who are nobly born, devoted to poetry and fine art, and
    possess manifest power in portraiture, should aim at the Heroic
    in painting. Make this your first and steadfast purpose. Devote
    to it your life and soul; and, should the power to reach this
    elevation be wanting, you may still achieve the Beautiful, and
    paint lovely women in lovely attitudes. But tell me,
    Antonello!" continued he, resuming his wonted kindness, "how
    came that horrid visage across thy path, or rather across thy
    fancy? for surely no such original exists. Say, didst thou see
    it living, or was it the growth of those distempered dreams to
    which painters, more than other men, are subject?"</p>

    <p>"No, padre mio! it was no dream," eagerly answered his
    pupil. "Yesterday I went in our gondola, as is my wont on
    festivals, to the beautiful church of San Moyses, which I love
    for its oriental and singular architecture. When near the
    church I heard a melodious voice calling to Jacopo, my
    gondolier, the only boatman in sight, and begging a conveyance
    across the canal. Issuing from the cabin, I saw a tall figure,
    closely veiled, standing on the steps of the palace facing the
    church and occupied by the Archduke's ambassador. Approaching
    the steps, Jacopo placed a plank for the stranger; but, as she
    stepped out to reach it, a sudden gust caught her large loose
    mantle, which, clinging to her shape, displayed for a moment a
    form of such majestic and luxuriant fulness&mdash;such perfect
    and glorious symmetry, as no man, still less an artist, could
    look on unmoved. In trembling and indescribable impatience, I
    awaited the raising of her veil. Another gust, and a slight
    stumble as she bounded rather than stepped into the boat,
    befriended <span class="pagenum"><a id="page301"
       name="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span> me; the partial shifting
       of her veil, which she hastily replaced, permitted a glimpse
       of her features&mdash;brief, indeed, but never to be
       forgotten. Yes, father! the face which surmounted that
       goddess-like and splendid person, was the horrid visage I
       have sketched, lean and yellow, drawn up into innumerable
       wrinkles, and with black eyes of intolerable brightness,
       blazing out of deep and faded sockets. Staggered by this
       unearthly contrast, I fell back upon the bench of the
       gondola, and gazed in silent horror at the stranger, who
       answered not the blunt questions of Jacopo; and, as if
       ashamed of her astounding ugliness, sat motionless and
       shrouded from head to foot in her capacious mantle. I
       followed her into the church; but, unable to hold out during
       the mass, I left her there and hastily returned to sketch
       this sublime example of the hideous before any of its points
       had faded from my memory. Forgive me, father, for yielding
       to an impulse so strong as to overwhelm all power of
       resistance. Yet why should I abandon this rare opportunity
       of displaying any skill I may have gained from so gifted a
       teacher? Pictures of Madonnas and of lovely women so abound
       in all our palaces, that a young artist can only rise above
       the common level by representing something extraordinary,
       something rarely or never seen in life."</p>

    <p>Contarini gazed with sorrowing and affectionate interest
    upon the flushed features of his pupil, again excited as before
    by his own description of the mysterious stranger. One less
    acquainted with human nature, would have mistaken the flashing
    eyes and animated features of the youthful artist for the sure
    tokens of conscious and advancing talent; but the aged painter,
    whose practised eye was not dazzled by the soft harmony of
    features which gave a character of feminine beauty to Antonio,
    saw in the excitement which failed to give a more intellectual
    character to his countenance, sad evidence of a soul too feeble
    and infirm of purpose to achieve eminence in any thing, and
    with growing alarm he inferred a predisposition to mental
    disease from those morbid and uncontrolled impulses, which
    delighted in portraying objects revolting to all men of sound
    and healthy feelings.</p>

    <p>He arose in evident emotion, and after pacing the studio
    some time in silence, he approached Antonio, who, yielding to
    his eccentric longings, had seized the sketch of the old
    woman's head, and was gazing on it with evident delight. "Give
    me the sketch, Antonio!" resumed the painter in his kindest
    tone, "'Tis finished, and the hunter cares not for the hunted
    beast when stricken. What wouldst thou with it?" "What would I,
    maestro?" exclaimed the alarmed youth, hastily removing his
    sketch from the extended hand of the painter, "Finish the
    subject of course, and place this wonderful old head upon the
    magnificent form to which it belongs."</p>

    <p>"But, saidst thou not, Antonio, that the poor creature in
    the gondola hastily concealed her features when accident
    revealed them, as if ashamed of her unnatural ugliness? And
    canst thou be so heartless as to publish to the world that
    strange deformity she is doomed to bear through life, and which
    she is evidently anxious to conceal? Wouldst thou add another
    pang to the existence of one to whom life is worse than death,
    and whose eternal veil is but a foretaste of the winding-sheet
    and the grave? Thou wilt not, canst not, my Antonio, make such
    unheard-of misery thy stepping-stone to fame and fortune." This
    impassioned appeal to all his better feelings at length reached
    the heart of Antonio. For a short time he continued to withhold
    the drawing; but his kindly nature triumphed. Tearing his
    sketch into fragments, he threw himself into the extended arms
    of his beloved teacher, who with deep emotion placed his
    trembling hand on the curling locks of his pupil, and implored
    the blessing of Heaven on his better feelings and purposes.</p>

    <p>With a view to improve the impression he had made, the
    painter led Antonio round the studio, and sought to fix his
    attention upon several portraits of lovely women which adorned
    it. "Here," said he, "are heads worthy to crown that striking
    figure in the gondola. Behold that all-surpassing portrait by
    Giorgione, of such beauty as painters and poets may dream of
    but never find, and yet not superhuman in its type. Too
    impassioned for an angel; too brilliant <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page302"
       name="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span> for a Madonna; and with
       too much of thought and character for a Venus&mdash;she is
       merely <i>woman</i>. Belonging to no special rank or class
       in society, and neither classical nor ideal, she personifies
       all that is most lovely in her sex; and, whether found in a
       palace or a cottage, would delight and astonish all
       beholders. This rarely gifted woman was the daughter of
       Palma Vecchio, and the beloved of Giorgione, one of the
       handsomest men of his time; but her sympathies were not for
       him, and he died of grief and despair in his prime. She was
       the favourite model of Titian and his school, and the type
       that more or less prevails in many celebrated pictures.</p>

    <p>"How different and yet how beautiful of its kind, is that
    portrait of a Doge's daughter, by Paris Bordone! Less dazzling
    and luxuriant in her beauty than Palma's daughter, she is in
    all respects intensely aristocratic. In complexion not rich and
    glowing, but of a transparent and pearly lustre, through which
    the course of each blue vein is visible. In shape and features
    not full and beautifully rounded, but somewhat taller and of
    more delicate symmetry. In look and attitude not open, frank,
    and natural; but astute, refined, courteous, and winning to a
    degree attainable only by aristocratic training and the habits
    of high society. In apparel, neither national nor picturesque,
    but attired with studied elegance. Rich rows of pearls wind
    through her braided hair, in colour gold, in texture soft as
    silk. A band of gold forms the girdle of her ruby-coloured
    velvet robe, which descends to the wrist, and there reveals the
    small white hand and tapering fingers of patrician beauty. All
    this may captivate the fastidious noble; but, to men less
    artificial in their tastes and habits, could such a woman be
    better than a statue&mdash;and could love, the strongest of
    human passions, be ever more to her than a short-lived and
    amusing pastime?</p>

    <p>"From these immortal portraits, my Antonio, you may learn
    that <i>colour</i> was the grand secret of the great Venetian
    painters. <i>Their</i> pale forms are never white, nor their
    blooming cheeks rose-colour, but the true colour of
    life&mdash;mellow, rich, and glowing; both men and women
    strictly true to nature, and looking as if they could turn pale
    with anger or blush with tender passion. From these great men
    can best be learned how much charm may be conveyed by
    <i>colour</i>, and what life and glow, what passion, grace, and
    beauty it gives to <i>form</i>.</p>

    <p>"But I weary thee, Antonio; and after such excitement thou
    hast need of repose. To-morrow, let me see thee early."</p>

    <p>The exhausted youth gladly departed from a scene of so much
    trial; and, hastening to his gondola, sought refreshment in an
    excursion to the Lido. Returning after nightfall, he landed on
    the Place of St Mark's, and wandered through its cool arcades
    until they were deserted. In vain, however, did he strive to
    banish the graceful form and grisly features of the stranger.
    The strong impression he had received became so vivid and
    absorbing, that at every turn he thought he saw her gazing at
    him as if in mockery, and lighting up the deep shadows beneath
    the arches with her glowing orbs, which seemed to his
    disordered fancy to emit sparks and flashes of fire. No longer
    able to resist the impulse, forgetting alike the paternal
    admonitions of the old painter, and the promises so sincerely
    given, he quitted the piazza and hastened to the palace of his
    father, the Proveditore Marcello, then absent on state affairs
    in the Levant.</p>

    <p>Retiring to his own apartment, he fixed an easel with
    impetuous haste, and by lamplight again began to sketch the
    Medusa head of the old woman. Yielding himself up to this new
    frenzy, he succeeded beyond his hopes; a supernatural power
    seemed to guide his hand, and soon after midnight he had drawn
    to the life not only the appalling head, but the commanding and
    beautiful person, of the mysterious personage in the gondola.
    After gazing awhile upon his work with triumphant delight, he
    retired to bed; but slept not until long after sunrise, and
    then the extraordinary incidents of the past day haunted his
    feverish dreams. A female form, youthful and of surpassing
    beauty, hovered around his couch, but ever changing in
    appearance. At first her head was invisible and veiled in mist,
    from which, at intervals, flashed features of
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303"
       name="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span> resplendent loveliness,
       and eyes of heavenly blue, which beamed upon him with
       thrilling tenderness; and then the mist dispersed, and the
       beauteous phantom stooped down to kiss his cheek, when
       suddenly her blooming face darkened and withered into the
       death-like visage of that fearful stranger, and her long
       bright hair was converted into hissing sepents. Starting
       with a scream of horror from his troubled and exhausting
       slumbers, he again sought refuge in his gondola, but
       returned, alas! to make his sketch into a picture, which the
       hues of life made still more hideous and repulsive. After
       several days thus occupied, he sketched in various attitudes
       the imposing figure of the old woman, and endeavoured to fit
       this beautiful Torso with a head not unworthy of it. But
       herein, after many attempts, he failed. His excitement, so
       long indulged, had risen into fever. His diseased fancy
       controlled his pencil, and blended with features of the
       highest order of beauty so many touches of the old woman's
       ghastly visage, that he threw down his pencil, and abandoned
       all further efforts in despair.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

    <h4>THE CAVERN.</h4>

    <p>The shores of Austrian Dalmatia south of the port of Fiume,
    are of so rugged and dangerous a nature, that although broken
    into numerous creeks and bays, there are but few places where
    vessels, even of small dimensions, dare to approach them, or
    indeed where it is possible to effect a landing. A long
    experience of the coast, and of the adjacent labyrinth of
    islands which block up the gulf of Carnero, is necessary in
    order to accomplish in safety the navigation of the shallow
    rocky sea; and even when the mariner succeeds in setting foot
    on land, he not unfrequently finds his progress into the
    interior barred by precipices steep as walls, roaring torrents,
    and yawning ravines.</p>

    <p>It was on a mild evening of early spring, and a few days
    after the incidents recorded in the preceding chapter, that a
    group of wild-looking figures was assembled on the Dalmatian
    shore, opposite the island of Veglia. The sun was setting, and
    the beach was so overshadowed by the beetling summits of the
    high chalky cliffs, that it would have been difficult to
    discover much of the appearance of the persons in question, but
    for an occasional streak of light that shot out of a narrow
    ravine opening among the rocks in rear of the party, and lit up
    some dark-bearded visage, or flashed on the bright barrel of a
    long musket. High above the ravine, and standing out against
    the red stormy-looking sky behind it, the outline of a fortress
    was visible, and in the hollow beneath might be distinguished
    the small closely-built mass of houses known as the town of
    Segna.</p>

    <p>This castle, which, by natural even more than artificial
    defences, was deemed impregnable, especially on its sea face,
    was the stronghold of a handful of hardy and desperate
    adventurers, who, although their numbers never exceeded seven
    hundred men, had yet, for many years preceding the date of this
    narrative, made themselves a name dreaded throughout the whole
    Adriatic. The inhabitants of the innumerable Dalmatian islands,
    the subjects of the Grand Turk, the people of Ancona&mdash;all,
    in short, who inhabited the shores of the Adriatic, and were
    interested in its commerce, or in the countless merchant
    vessels that skimmed over its waters&mdash;trembled and turned
    pale when the name of these daring freebooters was mentioned in
    their hearing. In vain was it that the Sultan, who in his
    sublimity scarcely deigned to know the names of some of the
    great European powers, had caused his pachas to take the field
    with strong armaments for the extermination of this nest of
    pirates. These expeditions were certainly not disadvantageous
    to the Porte, which seized the opportunity of annexing to its
    dominions some large slices of Hungarian and Venetian
    territory; but their ostensible object remained unaccomplished,
    and the proverbial salutation <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page304"
       name="page304"></a>[pg 304]</span> of the time, "God save
       you from the Uzcoques!" was still on the lips of every
       one.</p>

    <p>The word "Uzcoque," by which this dreaded people was known,
    had grown into a sound of mourning and panic to the inhabitants
    of the shores and islands of the Adriatic. At the utterance of
    that fearful name, young girls crowded together like frightened
    doves; the child hid its terrified face in its mother's lap;
    the eyes of the matron overflowed with tears as the images of
    murdered sons and outraged daughters passed before her mind's
    eye, and, like Banquo's ghost, filled the vacant seats at the
    table; while the men gazed anxiously out, expecting to see
    their granaries and store-houses in flames. Nor were the
    seaman's apprehensions less lively, when night surprised him
    with some valuable cargo in the neighbourhood of the pirates'
    haunts. Every rock, each tree, and bush became an object of
    dread; the very ripple of the waves on the shingle a sound of
    alarm. To his terrified fancy, a few leafless and projecting
    branches assumed the appearance of muskets, a point of rock
    became the prow of one of those light, sharp-built boats in
    which the Uzcoques were wont to dart like seabirds upon their
    prey; and, invoking his patron saint, the frightened sailor
    crossed himself, and with a turn of the rudder brought his
    vessel yet nearer to the Venetian galleys that escorted the
    convoy.</p>

    <p>At the cry "Uzcoque" the slender active Albanian grasped his
    fire-lock, with rage and hatred expressed on his bearded
    countenance: the phlegmatic Turk sprang in unwonted haste from
    his carpet; his pipe and coffee were neglected, his women and
    treasures secured in the harem, while he shouted for the
    Martellossi,<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
       "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> and slipping them like dogs
       from a leash, sent them to the encounter of their foes on
       the devastated plains of Cardavia. In the despatches from
       Madrid, from the ministers of that monarch on whose
       dominions the sun never set, to his ambassadors, the name of
       these seven hundred outlaws occupied a frequent and
       prominent place. But by none were the Uzcoques more feared
       and detested than by the greyheaded doge and senators of the
       Ocean Queen, the sea-born city, before whose cathedral the
       colours of three kingdoms fluttered from their crimson
       flagstaffs; and the few young Venetians in whose breasts the
       remembrance of their heroic ancestors yet lived, blushed for
       their country's degradation when they beheld her rulers
       braved and insulted by a band of sea-robbers.</p>

    <p>To this band belonged the wild figures, whose appearance on
    the shore has been noticed, and who were busily employed in
    rummaging a number of sacks and packages which lay scattered on
    the ground. They pursued their occupation in profound silence,
    except when the discovery of some object of unusual value
    elicited an exclamation of delight, or a disappointment brought
    a grumbling curse to their lips. They seemed carefully to avoid
    noise, lest it should draw down upon them the observation of
    the castle that frowned above their heads, and at the
    embrasures and windows of which they cast frequent and
    frightened glances, although the darkness of the ravine, at the
    entrance of which they had stationed themselves, and the
    rapidly deepening twilight, rendered it almost impossible to
    discover them.</p>

    <p>"By the beard of the prophet, Hassan!" exclaimed in a
    suppressed tone a young Turk, who lay bound hand and foot at a
    short distance from the pirates, "why do these mangy curs keep
    us lying so long on the wet grass? Why do they not seek their
    kennel up yonder?"</p>

    <p>The person addressed was a little, <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page305"
       name="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span> round, oily-looking Turk,
       a Levant merchant, whose traffic had called him to one of
       the neighbouring islands, and who had been laid hold of on
       his passage by the Uzcoques. He was sitting up, being less
       strictly manacled than his more youthful and
       energetic-looking companion; and his comical countenance
       wore a most desponding expression, as, in reply to the
       question put to him, he shook his head slowly from side to
       side, at the same time gravely stroking his beard.</p>

    <p>"By Allah!" exclaimed the young man impatiently, as he saw
    the pirates rummaging more eagerly than ever, and now and then
    concealing something of value under their cloaks, "could not
    the greedy knaves wait till they got home before they shared
    the plunder? May their fathers' souls burn!"</p>

    <p>"What saith the sage Oghuz?" quoth old Hassan slowly, "'As
    people grow rich their maw widens.'"</p>

    <p>"Silence, unbelieving hound!" exclaimed a harsh voice behind
    him, and a thump between the shoulders warned the old Turk to
    keep his proverbs for a more fitting season. The pirate was
    about to repeat the blow, when suddenly his hand fell, and the
    curses died away upon his lips.</p>

    <p>The clouds that had hitherto veiled the setting sun had
    suddenly broken, and a broad stream of golden light poured down
    the ravine, flashing upon the roofs and gables of the town, and
    making the castle appear like a huge and magnificent lantern.
    The ravine was lighted up as though by enchantment, and the
    unexpected illumination caused an alarm among the group of
    pirates, not unlike that of an owl into whose gloomy
    roosting-place a torch is suddenly intruded. Terror was
    depicted upon their countenances as they gazed up at the
    castle. For a moment all was still and hushed as the grave, and
    the Uzcoques scarcely seemed to breathe as they drew their
    greedy hands in silent haste out of the sacks; then, suddenly
    recovering from their stupefaction, they snatched up their
    muskets and crowded into a dark cavern in the rock, which the
    beams of the setting sun had now for the first time rendered
    visible, without, however, lighting up its deep and dark
    recesses. In their haste and alarm, more than one of the
    freebooters had his tattered mantle caught by the thorny arms
    of some of the bushes scattered over the shore, and turned in
    terror, thinking himself in the grasp of a foe. A few only had
    the presence of mind to throw their cloaks over the varied and
    glittering plunder that lay scattered about on the ground; and
    strange was the contrast of the sparkling jewellery, the rich
    stuffs, and embroidered robes, strewed on the beach, with the
    mean and filthy garments that partially concealed them, and the
    wild and squalid figures of their present possessors.</p>

    <p>A number of the Uzcoques now threw themselves with brutal
    violence upon the two prisoners, muffled their heads in cloaks
    to prevent their crying out, and carried them with the speed of
    light into the cave, in the innermost recess of which they
    bestowed them. They then rejoined their companions, who were
    grouped together at the entrance of the cavern like a herd of
    frightened deer, and gazing anxiously up at the castle. After
    the lapse of a very few minutes, the bright glow again faded
    away, the fortress reassumed its black and frowning aspect, the
    roofs of Segna relapsed into their dull grey hue, and shadows,
    deeper than before, covered the ravine.</p>

    <p>Reviving under the influence of the darkness, so congenial
    to their habits and occupations, the Uzcoques began to recover
    from their alarm, and the murmur of voices was again heard as
    they seized the sacks, and hastily filled them with the various
    objects lying on the beach. Every thing being collected, the
    pirates commenced toiling their way up the steep mountain path
    leading to the castle, with the exception of a few who still
    lingered at the entrance of the cavern, and whom the prisoners
    could hear disputing about some point on which there seemed to
    exist much difference of opinion.</p>

    <p>"Hell and the devil!" at last exclaimed an impatient voice,
    in a louder tone than had yet been employed. "There's little
    chance that we have not been seen from the castle; for the
    warder would expect us back about this time, and doubtless was
    on the look-out. These Turkish hounds have <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page306"
       name="page306"></a>[pg 306]</span> seen every thing, and
       might easily betray us. Let us leave them here till
       to-morrow, till I have spoken to the warder, and arranged
       that they be sent on at once to Gradiska without coming to
       speech of the captain. I will join the escort myself to make
       it still surer."</p>

    <p>After some slight opposition on the part of the others, this
    proposal was adopted, and the remaining pirates took their
    departure. The sound of their footsteps along the rocky path
    had scarcely died away on the ears of the anxiously listening
    captives, when loud acclamations and cries of joy announced the
    arrival of the first detachment at the castle. The heavy gates
    of the fortress were opened with much din and rattle; after a
    short space they were again slammed to, the portcullis fell,
    and then no further sound broke the deep silence that reigned
    in the ravine.</p>

    <p>The collection of the plunder, the discussion among the
    pirates, and their departure, had passed so rapidly, that the
    young Turk had scarcely had time to recover from the giddy,
    half-stunned state into which the rough usage he had received
    had thrown him, when he found himself alone with his old
    fellow-captive.</p>

    <p>"Well, Hassan," said he at last, in a voice of suppressed
    fury, "what think you of all this?"</p>

    <p>The old man made no verbal reply, but merely stroked his
    beard, shrugged his shoulders, and opened his eyes wider than
    before, as much as to say, "I don't think at all; what do you
    think?"</p>

    <p>"It is not the prospect of passing the night in this damp
    hole, bound hand and foot, that chafes me to madness, and makes
    my very blood boil in my veins," resumed the young man after a
    pause. "That is a small matter, but"&mdash;</p>

    <p>"A small matter!" interrupted Hassan with unusual vivacity.
    "That is, because you have forgotten the most dreadful part of
    our position. Bound hand and foot as we are, we can expect
    nothing less than to fall, ere cock-crow, into the power of
    Satan."</p>

    <p>"Of Satan!" repeated the other. "Has terror turned thy
    brain?"</p>

    <p>"Of a truth, the Evil One has already tied the three fatal
    nooses which he hangs over the head of the sleeping believer,"
    replied the old Mahometan in a lachrymose tone. "He who awakes
    and forthwith invokes the holy name of Allah, is thereby
    delivered from the first noose; by performing his ablutions,
    the second becomes loosened; and by fervent prayer he unties
    the third. Our bonds render it impossible for us to wash, and
    the second noose, therefore, will remain suspended over our
    devoted heads."</p>

    <p>"Runs it so in the Koran, old man?" asked the youth.</p>

    <p>"In the Koran! What Mussulman are you? It is the hundred and
    forty-ninth passage of the Suna."</p>

    <p>"The Suna!" repeated the other, in a tone of indifference.
    "If that is all, it will not break my slumbers."</p>

    <p>"Allah protect me!" exclaimed the old man, as he made an
    attempt to pluck out his beard, which the shackles on his
    wrists rendered ineffectual. "Allah protect me! Is it not
    enough that I have fallen into captivity? Am I also doomed to
    pass the night under the same roof with an unbeliever, even as
    the Nazarenes are?"</p>

    <p>"May the bolt of Heaven fall on thy lying tongue!" exclaimed
    the youth in great wrath. "I an unbeliever! I, Ibrahim, the
    adopted son of Hassan, pacha of Bosnia!"</p>

    <p>In deepest humility did the old merchant bow his head, and
    endeavour to lay hold of the hem of the young man's crimson
    caftan, in order to carry it to his lips.</p>

    <p>"Enough! enough!" said Ibrahim, whose good temper had
    returned. "You spoke in haste and ignorance. I am well pleased
    when I break no commandment of the Koran; and trouble my head
    little about the sayings of those babbling greybeards, the
    twelve holy Imaums."</p>

    <p>"But the nooses," expostulated Hassan, not a little
    scandalized by his companion's words.</p>

    <p>"You have nothing to do but to sleep all night without
    awaking," replied the young Turk laughing. "Then you will have
    no need either to wash or pray."</p>

    <p>The superstitious old man turned his face to the wall in
    consternation and anguish of spirit.</p>

    <p>"This night have I seen with my own eyes what we have
    hitherto <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307"
       name="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span> refused to believe,"
       resumed Ibrahim after a pause, and in a tone of indignation
       that echoed through the cavern. "I am now convinced that the
       shameless scoundrels do not rob on their own account, since
       they are obliged to pilfer and conceal a part of their
       plunder in order to get a profit from their misdeeds. Marked
       you not, Hassan, how they trembled when the sun lit up the
       ravine, lest their tricks should be espied by some sentry on
       the battlements; and how their panic fear made them carry
       every thing up to the castle?"</p>

    <p>The old Turk bowed his head assentingly.</p>

    <p>"Glory be to God and the Sultan!" continued the youth.
    "Before the bright countenance of the prophet's vicegerent, who
    reigneth in Stamboul, no misdeed can remain hidden that occurs
    in the remotest corner of his vast dominions. Nay, much of what
    happens in the land of the Giaour is also manifest to his
    penetrating vision. Witness the veil of turpitude and cunning
    which has long been seen through by the clear eyes of our holy
    mollahs, and of the council at the Seraglio, and which has just
    now been torn away from before me, like a mist dispersing in
    the sunshine of truth. Truly spoke the Christian maiden, whom
    but a few weeks back I took captive in a fight with the
    Uzcoques, but who was shortly after rescued by another band of
    those raging fiends."</p>

    <p>"Saw you the maiden," exclaimed Hassan, "the good maiden
    that accompanies the pirates, like an angel walking among
    demons?"</p>

    <p>"What know you of the Houri?" eagerly demanded the youth, in
    vain endeavouring to raise his head from the damp stones.</p>

    <p>"That it was the hand of Allah that rescued her from you,"
    replied the other. He chastiseth his creatures with rods, but
    even in his chastisemcnt is mercy. "How many more had not the
    dogs and the ravens devoured, had the Christian maiden been
    taken from among the Uzcoques? She belongs to them, she is the
    daughter of their leader, the terrible Dansowich, beside whom
    she is ever to be found, instilling the musk and amber of
    mildness into his fierce soul, and pouring healing into the
    wounds he makes. I know her not, but often have I heard the
    Christians, with whom my traffic brought me acquainted, include
    her in the prayers they addressed to their God."</p>

    <p>"Her eyes were as brilliant stars, and they blinded my very
    soul," exclaimed Ibrahim impetuously; "the honey of her words
    dropped like balm into my heart! As the sound of bubbling
    fountains, and the rustle of flowery groves to the parched
    wanderer in the desert, fell her sweet voice upon my ear. So
    gentle and musical were its tones, that I thought not of their
    meaning, and it is only to-day that I understand them."</p>

    <p>"I know not," quoth Hassan, "what you may have seen; but
    doubtless, Satan, who wished to inspire you with an unholy
    desire for a Nazarene woman, began by blinding you. According
    to all I have heard, the Uzcoque maiden is good and
    compassionate, but as ugly as night."</p>

    <p>"Ugly!" cried Ibrahim, "Then there must be two of them; for
    the one I saw was blooming as the spring, her eyes like the
    morning star, and her cheeks of velvet. Oh, that I could again
    behold her! In that hope it was that I pressed so rashly
    forward in the fight, and was made prisoner; but yet have I not
    beheld the pearl of mine eyes."</p>

    <p>"She cannot be amongst them," said Hassan; "and thence comes
    it that the pirates have this year committed greater cruelties
    than ever, and done deeds that cry out to Allah for
    vengeance."</p>

    <p>"Instead of her silver tones," continued Ibrahim, "I hear
    the shrieks of the tortured; instead of her words of peace and
    blessing, the curses of the murderer."</p>

    <p>"But what did the maiden tell you?" enquired Hassan, who was
    getting impatient at the transports of the enamoured youth.</p>

    <p>"Her words flowed like a clear stream out of the well of
    truth. It is not the Uzcoques alone," said she, "who are to
    blame for the horrors that"&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Hark!" interrupted the old Turk.</p>

    <p>A clamour of voices and splashing of oars became audible, a
    keel grated on the beach, and then hurried footsteps were heard
    in the ravine.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page308"
       name="page308"></a>[pg 308]</span> "It is another vessel
       with Uzcoques!" exclaimed Ibrahim; "but these are not laden
       with plunder, their movements are too rapid."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the tumult and murmur of voices and trampling
    of feet increased, and above all a noise like distant musketry
    was heard.</p>

    <p>"Holy Virgin!" suddenly exclaimed a clear and feminine
    voice, apparently close to the mouth of the cavern. "They are
    already at the castle&mdash;the gates, no doubt, are shut, the
    drawbridge raised. Before they could come down it would be too
    late."</p>

    <p>The young Turk started.</p>

    <p>"It is she, Hassan!" he exclaimed. "It is Strasolda, the
    Christian maiden!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, my father!" cried the same voice in tones of
    heart-rending anguish. "How shall we deliver thee? Alas! alas!
    who can tell the tortures they will make thee suffer in their
    dreadful dungeons?"</p>

    <p>The noise of the musketry became more and more distinct.
    Some of the newly arrived Uzcoques who had hurried up the
    winding path, were soon heard clamouring furiously for
    admittance at the castle gates.</p>

    <p>"They will be too late!" exclaimed the maiden, wringing her
    hands in despair. The next moment a sudden thought seemed to
    flash across her mind, lending her fresh hope and energy.</p>

    <p>"Gracious Heaven!" she exclaimed in joyful tones. "Have we
    not here the cave, from which, invoked by fire, the storm and
    the hurricane, the north wind and the tempest, come forth and
    shatter the most stately vessels against our iron-bound
    coast.<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href=
       "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> Up, Uzcoques, and fire the
       cavern! Let the elements do battle for us. Perchance by
       their aid the bark of your leader Dansowich may yet escape
       its foes and reach the haven."</p>

    <p>Immediately after these words, which made the two Moslems
    quail, the pirate's daughter hastily entered the cavern with a
    blazing torch, the flashes of which awakened from slumber into
    life and glow the various tints of mosses, lichens, and
    stalactites innumerable that studded the ample vault. In this
    flitting and singular illumination, the appearance of the
    Uzcoque maiden was awful. Above the common stature of woman,
    and finely formed, she was attired in a white woollen garment,
    carelessly adjusted and confined at the waist by broad red
    girdle, from which it fell in long and graceful folds to her
    feet. Her face was a perfect oval; her features of regular and
    striking beauty; her complexion, naturally of that clear rich
    brown, which lends more lustre to the eyes than the purest red
    and white, was now ghastly with intense alarm; and this
    death-like paleness imparted a more prominent and commanding
    character to her well-defined, jet-black brows, and the full,
    dark, humid eyes, which gleamed like brilliants through their
    long lashes. Heavy tresses of raven hair, escaping beneath her
    turban-like head-dress, streamed out like a sable banner as she
    rushed into the cavern, then fell and flowed in waving
    luxuriance over neck and shoulders to her girdle. The Turks in
    the interior of the cavern, gazed in speechless wonder at this
    beautiful apparition standing erect in the strong red light.
    Waving her torch with energetic and graceful action, she
    appeared like an antique sybil at the moment of inspiration, or
    some Arabian enchantress preparing for an incantation. Their
    admiration, however, yielded to alarm, when they beheld her
    dash the torch <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309"
       name="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span> upon the ground, and her
       attendants pile upon it straw and fagots, which blazed up
       instantly to the cavern roof, emitting volumes of smoke that
       made the captives invisible, and by its suffocating
       influence deprived them erelong of all power of
       utterance.</p>

    <p>The evening was serene and still, with scarcely a breath of
    wind stirring, and the flames blazed upward to the cavern roof;
    only now and then a light breeze from the sea wafted them on
    one side, and, at the sane time, dispersing the smoke, gave the
    Turks a momentary glimpse of the maiden, standing with uplifted
    hands, expectation, anxiety, and grief, depicted on her
    speaking countenance, as she invoked the spirit of the storm,
    while around her stood the few remaining Uzcoques, with
    sorrowing and downcast faces.</p>

    <p>"They come not!" she exclaimed after a pause, during which
    the fire began to burn low for lack of fuel, and the noise of
    the musketry diminished and finally ceased. "Uzcoques!" she
    cried in a louder voice, and with inspiration in her thrilling
    tones&mdash;"Take heed and warning, for your hour is come. Your
    crags and caverns, your rocky shores and howling storms, refuse
    you further service!"</p>

    <p>She paused, and at that moment was heard the rush of a
    rapidly approaching boat.</p>

    <p>"Speak not, ye messengers of evil!" exclaimed Strasolda in
    piercing accents. "Utter not a word. You have left Dansowich in
    the hands of the Venetians."</p>

    <p>There was no reply to her half frantic exclamation, and the
    deep silence was only broken by the footsteps of the
    new-comers, as with dejected looks they joined their
    companions. Just then some damp branches that had lain
    smouldering and smoking on the fire, burned brightly up, and by
    their light Ibrahim and Hassan beheld the maiden kneeling in
    the midst of the pirates, her tearful face covered by her fair
    and slender fingers. The next moment she raised her head and
    gazed into the cavern.</p>

    <p>As she did so, the sorrowful expression of her features
    changed, and her countenance was lighted up with a look of
    rapture, while a loud cry burst from her lips. Through the
    opening in the smoke, the prisoners became visible to her as
    they lay motionless in the interior of the cave, the light from
    the flames glowing on their red garments, and giving them the
    appearance of two statues of fire. In the handsome countenance
    of one of the figures thus suddenly revealed to her, Strasolda
    recognized the young Moslem, whose prisoner she had been, and
    whose noble person and bearing, courteous manners, and gentle
    treatment, had more than once since the day of her captivity,
    occupied the thoughts and fancy of the Uzcoque maiden. Unaware
    of Ibrahim's capture, Strasolda did not for an instant suppose
    that she beheld him in flesh and blood before her. To her
    excited and superstitious imagination, the figures of the Turks
    appeared formed out of fire itself, and she doubted not that
    the spirits of the cave had chosen this means of presenting to
    her, as in a prophetic mirror, a shadowy fore-knowledge of
    future and more favourable events.</p>

    <p>While she yet gazed eagerly on what she deemed a
    supernatural appearance, the rent in the veil of smoke suddenly
    closed, the flame sank down, and again all was gloom and
    darkness in the cavern. The thick stifling vapour of the damp
    wood, augmenting as the flame diminished, was now so
    overpowering that the Turks were in imminent danger of
    suffocation. In their extremity, making a violent effort, their
    pent up voices found vent in a cry of such startling wildness,
    that the Uzcoques, struck with terror, sprang back from the
    mouth of the cave, hurrying the maiden with them. The cry was
    not repeated, for the Turks had lost all consciousness from the
    stifling effects of the smoke.</p>

    <p>"Banish your fears, Uzcoques!" exclaimed Strasolda, staying
    the fugitives. "The voice that to you is a sound of dismay,
    gives me hope and confidence. I see the golden crescent rising
    in irresistible might, and shedding its rays over all the lands
    of the earth. Happy they on whom it casts its mild and
    favouring beams, and truer far the safeguard it affords to
    those who serve it, than that which is found beneath the shadow
    of the cross. Better the sharp cimeter and <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page310"
       name="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span> plighted word of the
       Moslem, than the fair promises of the lying Christian, who,
       in the hour of peril, abandons those by whose courage he has
       profited. But enough!" cried she in an altered tone. "Our
       first duty is to rescue my father from the hands of the
       Venetians. Go not into Segna. There are traitors there who
       might reveal what we most wish kept secret. The Venetians
       know not the person of Dansowich, and that may save him if
       no time be lost in plotting his deliverance. Let none even
       of our own people hear of his captivity. Now to the
       castle!"</p>

    <p>She led the way, and in silence and sadness the pirates
    followed the daughter of their captive chief.</p>

    <p>The fire was quite out, the smoke had cleared away, the moon
    poured its silvery light into the cavern, and the stillness was
    unbroken, save by the ripple of the waves on the beach, when
    Ibrahim recovered from the state of insensibility into which he
    had been thrown by the suffocating influence of the smoke, and
    heard his companion snoring at his side. For some time the
    young Turk lay, revolving in his mind the eventful scene he had
    witnessed, and the strange and startling circumstances that had
    come to his knowledge during the few preceding hours. The
    capture of Dansowich was an event of much importance; nor was
    there less weight in the discovery Ibrahim had made of the
    dependence of the Uzcoques upon a higher power, which, in
    secret, aided and profited by their depredations. Although
    Austria had been frequently accused of abetting the piracies of
    the Uzcoques, the charge had never been clearly proved, and to
    many appeared too improbable to obtain credence. Ibrahim had
    hitherto been among the incredulous; but what he had this day
    seen and heard, removed every doubt, and fully convinced him of
    the justice of those imputations.</p>

    <p>Turning in disgust from the contemplation of the labyrinth
    of crime and treachery to which he had seized the clue; the
    young Moslem sought and found a far pleasanter subject of
    reflection in the remembrance of the maiden, whose transcendent
    beauty and touching devotion to her captive parent, shone out
    the more brightly from their contrast with the vice and
    degradation by which she was surrounded. With much interest did
    he endeavour to solve the problem, and explain what appeared
    almost miraculous, how so fair a creature&mdash;such a
    masterpiece of Heaven's handiwork&mdash;could have passed her
    childhood and youth amongst the refuse of humanity assembled on
    the island, and yet have retained the spotless purity which was
    apparent in every look and gesture. But, however interesting
    these reflections were to the enamoured Ibrahim, his recent
    fatigues had been too great for nature not to assert her
    claims, and the wearied body finished by triumphing over the
    rebellious restlessness of the excited spirit. The graceful
    form of Strasolda, and the wild figures of the Uzcoques, swam
    more and more indistinctly before his closing eyes, until he
    sank at last into a deep and refreshing slumber.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

    <h4>THE JEWELS.</h4>

    <p>The tribe of the Uzcoques, or Scochi, derived their name
    from <i>scoco</i>, a refugee or fugitive, a word bearing
    reference to their origin. Towards the commencement of the
    sixteenth century, a band of hardy and warlike men abandoned
    the the provinces of Southern Hungary, Bulgaria, and Servia,
    and took refuge in Dalmatia from the tyranny and ill usage of
    the Turks, who had overrun the first-named provinces.
    Accompanied by their wives and families, and recruiting their
    numbers as they went along, they at last reached the fortress
    of Clissa, situated in the mountains, a few miles from the old
    Roman town of Spalatro. There, with the permission of its
    owner, Pietro Crosichio, they established themselves, forming
    one of the outposts of Christendom, and thence carried on a war
    of extermination against the Turks, to whom they did a degree
    of injury that would appear <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page311"
       name="page311"></a>[pg 311]</span> quite incommensurate with
       the smallness of their numbers. The name of Uzcoque soon
       became known throughout the Adriatic as the synonyme of a
       gallant warrior, till at length the Turks, driven nearly
       frantic by the exploits of this handful of brave men, fitted
       out a strong expedition and laid siege to Clissa, with the
       double object of getting rid of a troublesome foe, and of
       advancing another step into Christian Europe.</p>

    <p>The different powers who had benefited greatly, although
    indirectly, by the enterprising valour of the Uzcoques,
    neglected to give them the smallest assistance in their hour of
    peril. After an heroic defence, Clissa fell into the hands of
    the Turks, and a scanty and disheartened remnant of its brave
    defenders fled northward to seek some new place of refuge. This
    they found in the fortress of Segna, then belonging to a Count
    Frangipani, who allowed them to occupy it; and, at the same
    time, Ferdinand the First of Austria bethought himself,
    although somewhat tardily, that the Uzcoques had deserved
    better at his hands, and at those of other Christian princes,
    than to be left to their own resources when assailed by the
    overwhelming power of the Porte. As a sort of atonement, he
    took them formally into his pay, to assist him in his wars
    against the infidel. But from this day forward the Uzcoques
    gradually declined in valour and in moral worth. From a race of
    heroes they degenerated into a horde of mercenary adventurers,
    and finally, of cruel and cowardly pirates. Their primitive
    customs and simple virtues were exchanged for the vices of
    refugees and criminals from Venice and other neighbouring
    states, who came in crowds to fill up the frequent vacancies
    occurring in their ranks.</p>

    <p>At length the military value of the Uzcoques being much
    impaired, and their services also less required, Austria became
    irregular in her payments, and at last entirely discontinued
    them. The barren mountains round Segna produced nothing, and
    the unfortunate Uzcoques were in danger of dying of hunger.
    This they felt by no means inclined to do, and erelong
    complaints began to be made of piracies and depredations
    committed by the Segnarese on the vessels and territory of
    Venice. For some time no application on the subject was made to
    Austria, and when made it was found to be of little avail.</p>

    <p>At the period to which this narrative refers, Austria had
    already formed those designs upon her southern neighbour, which
    in more modern times she has carried out with complete success.
    The fertile plains of Northern Italy, the convenient ports on
    the Adriatic, the rich commerce with the Levant, were tempting
    baits to what was then the most ambitious power in Europe; and
    with an undeviating steadiness did she follow up the policy
    which promised to place such desirable acquisitions within her
    grasp. Venice, whose power and importance were already on the
    decline, was the state against which her most strenuous efforts
    were directed; and nothing that could injure the trade, or
    lower the dignity and importance of the republic, was omitted
    by the Austrian Machiavels of the day. Insignificant as such a
    means of annoyance may appear, the band of Uzcoques was one of
    the prime engines employed to undermine the bulwarks of
    Venetian independence. Through her commerce had Venice achieved
    her greatness, and through her commerce was she to be assailed
    and overthrown. Whilst the Venetians, for the sake of their
    trade, had formed alliances with the Turks, the Austrians,
    professing great religious zeal, and hatred of the infidels, as
    well as a dread of further encroachments upon European
    territory, did all in their power to ruin the traffic and break
    the connexion between the republic and the Porte. The Uzcoques,
    who, although asserting a sort of independence, still dwelt on
    Austrian territory, and were reckoned as Austrian subjects,
    were secretly encouraged in the piracies which they committed
    indiscriminately against Turkish and Venetian vessels. These
    acts of piracy usually took place in the night, and could
    rarely be brought home to their perpetrators, although there
    could be no moral doubt as to the identity of the latter; but,
    even when proved, it was found impossible to obtain any
    substantial redress. At the time now referred to, the evil was
    at its height. Nominally <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312"
       name="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span> peace both with Venice
       and the Porte, Austria, nevertheless, stimulated the
       Uzcoques to aggressions upon the subjects of both. The
       Archduke Ferdinand, a well-intentioned and virtuous prince,
       but young and inexperienced, was completely led and deceived
       by the wily and unprincipled politicians who governed in his
       name. He was kept entirely in the dark as to the real
       character of the Segnarese, and thus prevented from giving
       credence to the frequent complaints made against them by
       neighbouring states. His corrupt ministers, moreover, not
       content with making the pirates instrumental in this
       tortuous policy, were not ashamed to squeeze from them a
       portion of their illicit gains; and a lion's share of the
       spoil found its way into the coffers of the archducal
       counsellors, who welcomed the golden Pactolus, utterly
       regardless of the foul channel through which it flowed. The
       Uzcoques, on their part, who were no longer the race of
       brave and hardy soldiers they had been some half century
       before, clung to the protection of Austria, conscious that,
       in their degenerate state, and with their diminished
       numbers, they must soon fall a prey to their numerous foes,
       should that protection be withdrawn. Thus, although inwardly
       chafing at being compelled to disgorge a large part of the
       hard-won booty for which they frequently periled their
       lives, they did not dare to withhold the tribute, nor to
       omit the rich presents which they were in the habit of
       making to certain influential persons about the archducal
       court. In return, the ports of Austria on the Adriatic, were
       open to them to build and repair vessels, or obtain supplies
       of provisions; every species of indirect assistance was
       afforded them, and more than once, when some of their number
       had fallen into the hands of the Venetians, their release,
       as subjects of Austria, had been demanded and obtained by
       the authorities at Gradiska. On the other hand, the claims
       of Venice for satisfaction, when some of her richly laden
       merchant-ships had been captured or pillaged, were slightly
       attended to, the applicants put off from day to day, and
       from year to year, with promises and excuses, until the weak
       and cowardly republic, seeing that no satisfaction was to be
       obtained by peaceable means, and being in no state to
       declare war against her powerful neighbour, usually ended
       the matter by ceasing to advance claims, the prosecution of
       which only tended to her further humiliation.</p>

    <p>It was Easter Sunday in the town of Gradiska. The strict
    religious ceremonies with which the Passion week was
    commemorated at the court of the youthful but pious Archduke
    Ferdinand were at an end; the black hangings disappeared from
    the church walls, and the bells rang out a merry peal in joyful
    commemoration of the Saviour's resurrection. The nobles and
    ladies of the court, wearied with the vigils and fasting which
    the religious zeal of the time rendered imperative, betook
    themselves with lightened hearts to their apartments, the elder
    portion to repose, the younger ones to prepare for the
    brilliant festival and ball which the following day was to
    witness.</p>

    <p>In a richly furnished apartment of the castle, the young and
    handsome wife of one of the archducal counsellors was pacing up
    and down, her full and voluptuous form reflected on every side
    by the tall Venetian mirrors that covered the walls of the
    apartment. The lady was apparently in no gentle mood; her step
    was hurried and impatient, her face flushed, her lips peevishly
    compressed, and her irritation seemed to increase each time
    that she passed before a table on which were displayed a number
    of jewel-boxes and caskets, all open, and nearly all empty.
    Since the Easter festival of the preceding year, the caprices
    and necessities of this spendthrift beauty had abstracted one
    by one the rich kernels from these now worthless husks, and the
    recollection of the follies, or worse, in which their value had
    been squandered, now came to aggravate the vexation which the
    want of the jewels occasioned her. So absorbed was she in the
    consideration of her annoyances and perplexities, that for some
    time she took no notice of the presence of a young and graceful
    female in plain attire, who stood apparently in deep thought in
    the embrasure of one of the windows. The maiden had her back
    turned to the room; but the admirable contours of
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page313"
       name="page313"></a>[pg 313]</span> her fine figure, and the
       rich luxuriance of the jet-black locks that flowed over her
       shoulders, gave promise of a perfection that was not belied,
       when, on an exclamation of impatience from her mistress, she
       suddenly turned round, and revealed the beauteous features
       of Dansowich's daughter. She it was who formed the usual
       medium of communication between the pirates and their
       archducal allies; and during her frequent sojourns at
       Gradiska, she assumed the character of attendant on the
       counsellor's lady.</p>

    <p>"Holy Virgin!" exclaimed the court dame, stamping her foot
    violently on the polished floor. "What can detain the knaves?
    Say, girl! where can they be lingering?"</p>

    <p>Strasolda made no reply to this impetuous enquiry. She was
    no longer the excited and impetuous Uzcoque heroine, invoking
    the spirit of the storm amidst the precipices and caverns of
    her native shores. A total change had come over her. Her look
    was subdued, her cheek pale, her eyes red and swollen with
    weeping. She cast an humble and sorrowful glance at the lady,
    and a tear trembled on her long dark lashes.</p>

    <p>"Why come they not?" repeated the angry dame in a voice
    half-choked with passion. "By all the saints!" she continued,
    with a furious look at Strasolda, "I believe thy father,
    Dansowich, to be the cause of this delay; for well I know it is
    with small good-will he pays the tribute. But if the thieving
    knaves thus play me false, if the Easter gift is wanting, and
    for lack of jewels I am compelled to plead sickness, and pass
    to-morrow in my apartment, instead of, as heretofore, eclipsing
    every rival by the splendour of my jewels, rest assured,
    maiden, that thy robber friends shall pay dearly for their
    neglect. A word from me, and thy father, brethren, and kinsmen
    grace the gallows, and their foul eyrie is leveled with
    dust."</p>

    <p>Strasolda pressed her hands upon her heart, and burst into a
    flood of tears. Then throwing herself at the lady's
    feet&mdash;</p>

    <p>"That word you will never have the cruelty to utter," cried
    she. "Bethink you, noble lady, of the perils to which they are
    exposed. The bravest cannot command success, and you know not
    yet whether their last expedition may not have been
    unprosperous."</p>

    <p>"I!" replied her irritated mistress. "How should I be privy
    to their proceedings? But <i>you</i> ought to be able to give
    some tidings: Wherefore did you not accompany your father this
    last voyage?"</p>

    <p>"I told you, lady," answered Strasolda, "that I was busied
    with plans for the deliverance of the Uzcoques now held captive
    in Venice. I have brothers amongst those unfortunate prisoners,
    and it is the uncertainty of their fate which thus afflicts
    me."</p>

    <p>The maiden gazed tearfully and imploringly at the angry
    lady. It was not without good reason that she concealed from
    her the fact of her father's captivity. The stern and
    inflexible Dansowich had ever viewed with an eye of disapproval
    the connexion between his people and the counsellors at
    Gradiska; and the latter, aware of this, would not have been
    likely to take much pains for the release of one who was
    unfavourable to their interests. It was only, therefore, by
    representing the captive Uzcoques as less nearly connected with
    her, that Strasolda could hope for aid to rescue them from the
    hands of the Venetians.</p>

    <p>"So much the more should you desire the arrival of the
    tribute!" exclaimed the lady. "Did I not, at your request, make
    interest with our ambassador at Venice, that he should insist
    upon the surrender of the Uzcoques as Austrian subjects?
    Assuredly the feeble signoria will not venture to refuse
    compliance. A casket of jewels is but a paltry guerdon for such
    service, and yet even that is not forthcoming. But it is not
    too late to alter what has been done. If I say the word, the
    prisoners linger in the damp and fetid dungeons of the
    republic, until they welcome death as a blessing."</p>

    <p>"Alas, alas!" sobbed Strasolda; "have you the heart thus to
    add to my sorrow? Is it not enough to know those I love in
    captivity, to behold my people, once so noble and heroic,
    degraded to the very refuse of humanity despised and detested
    of all men, having their dwelling on a barren rock, and earning
    by crime and bloodshed a precarious existence
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page314"
       name="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span> and doubtful freedom? Is
       it not enough"&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Hush!" interrupted the lady in a quick sharp whisper,
    raising her finger, and glancing towards the door of the
    apartment. There was a noise as of stealthy footsteps in the
    corridor. Strasolda sprang from the kneeing posture which she
    had maintained during her conversation with her mistress, and
    resumed her station in the recess of a window, while the
    counsellor's lady snatched up a rich shawl from a damask
    covered ottoman, and threw it over the caskets spread out upon
    the table. Scarcely were these arrangements completed, when the
    door was partially opened, and a wild sunburnt and bearded
    countenance showed itself at the aperture.</p>

    <p>"Heaven and the saints be praised!" exclaimed the lady.
    "They are come at last. In with you, Jurissa Caiduch: there is
    no one but Strasolda here."</p>

    <p>The person thus addressed, was a strongly built and active
    man, rather under the middle size, muffled in a coarse brown
    cloak, which was drawn over the lower part of his face,
    apparently with a view to concealment. A broad-brimmed felt hat
    was slouched over his small black eyes, which glittered through
    its shadow like those of a snake, never fixing themselves on an
    object, but casting restless and suspicious glances, as though
    apprehensive of danger or treachery. Gliding into the room, and
    closing the door noiselessly behind him, he approached the
    table, and placed upon it a tolerably large casket, which he
    produced from under his cloak; then retreating a step or two,
    he removed his hat, and stood in an attitude of silent respect,
    his eyes still gleaming, however, with their habitual
    expression of mistrust and cunning.</p>

    <p>Without uttering a word, the lady seized the casket, and
    impatiently forced open its delicate silver lock. A cry of
    joyful surprise burst from her lips on beholding the rich
    contents of the jewel-case. Diamond chains, golden girdles and
    bracelets, combs and hair ornaments studded with orient pearls,
    passed in rapid succession through the white and eager fingers
    of the gratified dame, who seemed to lack words to express her
    pleasure and astonishment at the sight of such costly gems. At
    last she turned to the bearer.</p>

    <p>"Of a truth, Jurissa" cried she, "you are unusually liberal
    this time, and you must have great need of the good offices of
    myself and Father Cipriano, to be willing to purchase our
    influence with the archduke at so high a price."</p>

    <p>"Our last expedition was a successful one, noble lady,"
    replied the Uzcoque. "The tender-hearted Strasolda," added he
    with a spiteful glance at the maiden, who still kept her
    station by the window, "that guardian angel, who so often steps
    between us and our prey, was absent, and we had no need to stay
    our hands."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the door was again hastily opened as softly as
    before, but somewhat wider, and the burly figure of a monk
    entered the room. This was no other than the Father Cipriano
    Guido Lucchese, whom the lady had alluded to, and who, by his
    pleadings at the papal court, in favour of the Uzcoques, had
    earned himself the honourable cognomen of Ambassador de Ladri,
    or the Thieves' Envoy. He had expiated his discreditable
    intercession by a sojourn in the prisons of the Inquisition,
    which did not, however, present his being in high favour with
    the Archduke Ferdinand, at whose court he filled the triple
    office of theologian, confessor, and privy counsellor.</p>

    <p>The sleek and unctuous physiognomy of the monk wore an
    expression of unusual care and anxiety. Without bestowing a
    salutation or a look upon the lady whose apartment he thus
    unceremoniously entered, he addressed himself at once to the
    Uzcoque Jurissa.</p>

    <p>"Away with you!" cried he. "Out of the palace; and quietly,
    too, as your own shadow. Thumbscrews are waiting for you if you
    linger."</p>

    <p>Strasolda gazed in alarm at Father Cipriano. Jurissa thrust
    his right hand under his cloak, and seemed to clutch some
    weapon. Even the counsellor's dame for a moment turned her eyes
    from the jewels she was admiring to the anxious countenance of
    the padre.</p>

    <p>"Your last exploit will bring you into trouble," continued
    the latter to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315"
       name="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span> Jurissa. "You have gone
       beyond all bounds; and a special ambassador has arrived here
       from Venice."</p>

    <p>"Well!" replied the Uzcoque surlily, "was not the sack of
    doubloons sufficient fee to keep you at your post?"</p>

    <p>"I have but just left it," answered the monk, "and you may
    thank me if the storm is averted for the moment, although it
    must burst erelong. Before the ambassador could obtain his
    audience, I hurried to the archduke, and chanted the old ditty;
    told him you were the Maccabees of the century&mdash;the
    bulwarks of Christendom: that without you the Turks would long
    since have been in Gradiska&mdash;that the Venetians, through
    fear and lust of gain, were hand and glove with the followers
    of Mahomet&mdash;and that it was their own fault if you had to
    strike through them to get at the infidel: that they cared
    little about religion, so long as the convenience of their
    traffic was not interfered with&mdash;and that it would be a
    sin and a shame to deprive himself of such valiant defenders
    for the sake of obliging the republic. This, and much more, did
    I say to his highness, Signor Jurissa," concluded the fat
    priest, wiping away the perspiration which his eagerness and
    volubility had caused to start out on his brow; "and, in good
    truth, I think your paltry bag of doubloons but poor reward for
    the pains I took, and the zeal I have shown in your
    defence."</p>

    <p>"And wherein consists the danger, then," interrupted
    Jurissa, "since your eloquence has sped so well on our
    behalf?"</p>

    <p>"You do not hear me out, my son," replied the priest. "The
    greybeards at Venice have chosen an envoy who is right well
    informed of your small numbers, bad equipment, and cowardice in
    broad daylight. Nay, man, never grind your teeth. I do but
    repeat the ambassador's words; for I had stationed myself in an
    adjoining room, and heard all that passed between him and the
    archduke. He said, moreover, that, far from being of use as a
    bulwark against Turkish encroachments, it was you who had
    afforded to the infidels a pretext to wrest more than one rich
    province from Christian potentates. All this seemed to make
    some impression upon the archduke, and to plant suspicions in
    his mind which bode no good to you and your race. For the
    present, the capture of those two Turks, one of whom is a
    person of rank, is testimony in your favour with his highness,
    to whom the crescent is an abomination. Could he follow his own
    inclinations, he would, I fully believe, start a new crusade
    against the followers of Mahoun. But come, Jurissa, this is no
    time for gossip. You must not be seen in Gradiska. Away with
    you!"</p>

    <p>"And the Venetian," cried Jurissa, "what is his name?"</p>

    <p>"It is the Proveditore Marcello, who has lately returned
    from a long absence in the East."</p>

    <p>The Uzcoque started. The name seemed to have some potent and
    mysterious effect upon him, and he stood for a few moments with
    his eyes fixed upon the ground, apparently forgetful of the
    necessity for his immediate departure. The priest took him by
    the arm, and drew him towards the door, which he was about to
    open, when Jurissa shook off his grasp and hastily approached
    the counsellor's wife, who had thrown herself into a large
    gilded chair before one of the pier-glasses, and was busily
    engaged in trying on the ornaments that had just been brought
    her.</p>

    <p>"Have a care, noble lady!" cried the Uzcoque. "You will do
    well to let a couple of weeks elapse before you appear in
    public with those pretty gauds. At any rate, wear them not at
    to-morrow's ball, lest, perchance, they find an owner. Beware,
    lady, of the Proveditore Marcello!"</p>

    <p>With a look of peculiar meaning he left the room,
    accompanied by Father Cipriano. But his warning fell faintly
    upon the lady's ear, who, though she heard the words, was far
    too much engrossed in arranging and admiring the costly gems so
    lately become her own, to give much heed to their import. She
    remained before her mirror, loading her white neck and arms
    with chains and jewels, and interweaving diamonds and pearls in
    her tresses, regardless of the grief of Strasolda who sat in
    tears and sadness, deploring her father's increasing peril, and
    the cloud that menaced the future fortunes of her people.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

    <h4>THE BALL.</h4>

    <p>The ancient burg, or castle, of Gradiska had been originally
    on a larger scale, but, at this period, consisted only of a
    centre, flanked at right angles by two wings ending in square
    towers, large, grey, and massive, and embattled, with
    overhanging galleries for sentinels to pace along, while
    similar galleries, on a smaller scale, extended along the
    entire front and wings of the castle. The central edifice
    contained, on the ground-floor, numerous apartments and offices
    for menials; above which arose a spacious saloon and other
    lofty apartments, lighted by windows high above the flooring,
    and terminating in the round-headed arches so commonly seen in
    the castellated mansions of northern Italy. In this palatial
    hall preparation had been busy for the ball, to which the wife
    of the archducal counsellor so impatiently looked forward, as
    an opportunity to eclipse all rivals by the splendour of her
    jewels. The hour of reception by the archduke had arrived. The
    exterior of the spacious edifice was illuminated from end to
    end by nunerous torches, and the capacious staircase was
    lighted by a double rank of torch-bearers, in splendid apparel.
    In the interior of the vast apartment huge waxen tapers were
    fixed above the <i>chevron</i>, or zig-zag moulding, which ran
    round the walls, and connected the casement of each window.
    Large crystal lamps, pendant from the point of each inverted
    pinnacle on the lofty roof, diffused a flood of brilliant
    light, and imparted life and colour to the rich tapestries,
    portraying stirring scenes from the Crusades, which covered the
    walls from floor to window. Complete suits of armour,
    exhibiting every known device of harness, and numerous weapons,
    fancifully arranged, decorated the spaces between the windows.
    And now began to appear, in this scene of splendour, groups of
    knights and nobles, arrayed in velvet and cloth of gold, and
    attending upon fair dames, sparkling with jewels, and bearing
    nodding plumes upon their braided hair. Conspicuous amidst
    these, and towering above all in stature, appeared the haughty
    mistress of Strasolda, attired in a robe of dark green velvet,
    which well relieved the fairness of her complexion, and
    displaying upon her finely moulded neck and arms a collar and
    bracelets of large and lustrous oriental pearls. Her firlgers
    were bedecked with costly rings, and upon her head she wore an
    ornament of singular device, which soon attracted universal
    attention. Above the rim of a golden comb, richly chased and
    studded with brilliants, arose a peacock with expanded tail.
    The body was of chased gold in imitation of feathers, the
    arching neck was mosaic work of precious stones, the eyes were
    sparkling diamonds of the purest water, and the feathers of the
    tail glittered with emeralds, rubies, and sapphires of singular
    beauty and lustre. So great was the curiosity excited by the
    dazzling splendour of these jewels, that the fair wearer was
    followed round the room by a train of ladies, anxious to
    observe at leisure a display of ornaments so extraordinary, and
    whispering to sympathizing ears conjectures not over charitable
    to the counsellor's wife. When, at length, she had seated
    herself upon one of the sofas which lined the walls, a circle
    of admiring gazers was formed, whose numbers were rapidly
    increased by the attendant cavaliers. While the lady was
    enjoying her triumph, a bustle at the entrance of the hall
    turned every head in that direction, when the cause appeared in
    the person of the young archduke, who entered in full costume,
    followed by a group of courtiers, and accompanied by a Venetian
    cavalier, of tall and commanding person, with whom he appeared
    to be in earnest discourse. The stranger was a large-boned,
    spare, and powerful man, of middle age, and attired in a black
    vest and pantaloons of woven silk, with a short cloak, of the
    same hue. The golden hilt of his rapier, and a gold chain and
    medallion round his neck, were his only ornaments. His
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page317"
       name="page317"></a>[pg 317]</span> features were large,
       regular, and grand, and the gaze of his full dark eyes
       serene, yet firm and potent; his complexion pale, and
       contrasting strongly with a dark beard which circled his
       visage like a frame. His high and massive forehead, and well
       closed lips, had a character of thought and decision, while
       his mien and tread were those of one long accustomed to
       authority. He seemed a man born after his time, and worthy
       to have lived and acted in the high and palmy days of
       Venice. After attending the archduke to the steps of the
       dais at the upper end of the hall, he made his bow, and
       began to pace the floor in seeming abstraction from the gay
       scene around him. Arrested in his progress by the numerous
       groups which, after saluting the archduke, had again
       collected around the counsellor's lady, he paused in
       returning conciousness; and, looking for the cause of such
       unwonted attraction, was enabled, by his lofty stature, to
       obtain a glimpse of the jewelled lady within the circle. Her
       features were unknown to him; but when his careless gaze
       fell upon the rare ornament which crowned her redundant
       tresses, his countenance became suddenly darkened by some
       strong emotion. Again, he looked more earnestly, and with
       increasing wonder and curiosity. Controlling, by a sudden
       effort, all outward evidence of feeling, he watched his
       opportunity, and at length penetrating within the crowd,
       stood for some moments before the object of attraction, and
       gazed, as if admiringly, upon her various adornments in
       succession; then, bowing gracefully, he addressed to her
       some words of compliment upon the splendour and value of the
       dazzling bird upon her head. "Fair lady," he continued, "I
       have a daughter whom I fondly love, and fain would I bestow
       upon her youthful beauty such ornaments as yours. But say, I
       pray you, where can the cunning hand be found which fashions
       such glorious birds? Was it in Venice or Vienna that you
       bought this materpiece of art?" Unsuspicious of evil, and
       bridling at gratified vanity at this attention from a
       stranger of such distinguished mien, the spoil-bedecked fair
       one replied to him as she had done to others.</p>

    <p>"I bought this ornament, some weeks back, in Venice, at the
    store of a Greek trader from the Levant."</p>

    <p>"Ha!" exclaimed the stranger; "and where dwelt this Greek,
    that I may see and ask him for another such?"</p>

    <p>The concious lady, embarrassed by such close questioning,
    and somewhat alarmed by the kindling glances of the questioner,
    replied in haste&mdash;"Nay, signor, now I remember better, it
    was not a Greek I bought these gauds, but of a trading Jew, who
    walks the Merceria with a box of jewellry."</p>

    <p>"Just now, methinks, you said a Greek, fair lady; and now
    you say a Jew. What next? Why not a Moslem, or perchance <i>an
    Uzcoque?</i>"</p>

    <p>At this ominous conclusion, which the stranger muttered in
    tones of marked significance, the alarmed culprit started to
    her feet; and her fierce temper getting the better of her
    prudence, she boldly faced the cavalier, exclaiming, in a
    louder key than beseemed a courtier's wife&mdash;</p>

    <p>"And who are you, signor, that dare thus question the lady
    of an archducal counsellor?"</p>

    <p>"Lady!" he sternly answered, "here I am known to none save
    your husband's master; but in Venice men call me the
    Proveditore Marcello."</p>

    <p>And now flashed upon the indignant signora a fearful
    reminiscence of Jurissa's unheeded and forgotten warning, to
    hide her jewels for a time, and to beware of the Proveditore
    Marcello. In utter dismay, and nearly fainting with alarm, she
    sank upon the sofa, and her eyes expanded into the wide stare
    of terror as she gazed at the menacing visage of the Venetian
    noble. Unwilling to expose the conscience-striken woman before
    so numerous an assemblage, he seated himself beside her, and in
    tones inaudible to others thus whispered in her
    ear&mdash;"Lady! but eight days back the jewels that you wear
    were mine. That peacock was my own design, and made for my
    daughter by a cunning artificer in Candia. Its like exists not
    in the world; for the mould was made by my order, and broken as
    soon as used. 'Twas mine until the base Uzcoques plundered my
    baggage. How thus quickly it passed <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page318"
       name="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span> from them to you, is as
       well known to me as to yourself. But mark me, lady! if all
       these jewels are not delivered at my apartments in the west
       wing of the castle ere midnight, I will denounce your
       husband and his colleagues as long-suspected and now-proved
       partakers with the Pirates of Segna. And, should redress be
       denied me here, the ambassador of Venice shall report this
       infamous collusion before a higher tribunal in Vienna."</p>

    <p>Struck dumb by this terrible denunciation, the fair culprit
    gasped for breath, and her evident distress having been watched
    in growing wonder by the assembled ladies and cavaliers, the
    latter began to mutter threats of vengeance. One of them now
    stepped forward, and, grasping the hilt of his rapier, accused
    the Venetian of having insulted the wife of a nobleman high in
    the councils of the archduke, when the Proveditore, looking
    down upon the courtier with that riveted and intensely piercing
    gaze which staggers the beholder like a sudden blow, and may
    still be noted in many of Titian's portraits, answered with
    brief and startling emphasis&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Signor! you do me grievous wrong. 'Tis I, and not the lady,
    who am the injured party."</p>

    <p>Awed by his gathering brow, and the settled, stern,
    unsparing resolution which flashed from every feature, and
    indicated a man confident in his own resources, the courtiers
    did involuntary homage to his loftier spirit, and gave way. The
    proud Venetian strode through the yielding circle and quitted
    the hall, while the counsellor's wife, pleading illness and
    fatigue in reply to the pointed and numerous questions of
    surrounding friends and enemies, summoned her husband to attend
    her, and retired to her apartments.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the young Moslem and his companion in misfortune,
    who had been brought prisoners to Gradiska, were confined in
    one of the massive towers which flanked the castle. They had
    arrived not long before the comencement of the festival, and
    when going under guard along a corridor in the east wing,
    Ibrahim passed the open door of an apartment in which Strasolda
    was adjusting the rich jewels of the counsellor's lady before
    her appearance in the ball-room. Startled by the approaching
    tramp of armed men, the Uzcoque maiden raised her eyes, and
    beheld the noble and well-remembered features of the young
    Turk, whose captive she had been, and whose image had so
    strangely reappeared to her through the flitting cloud of smoke
    in the cavern. "Mother of Heaven!" she exclaimed, covering her
    eyes with her hands; "do I again behold that Moslem youth, ever
    appearing when least expected?" Again she gazed; but the
    prisoners, hurried onward by their guards, had proceeded to the
    end of the corridor, where a narrow winding staircase,
    fashioned in the immense thickness of the tower wall, led to
    their appointed prison, a large square apartment, the sides of
    which were panneled to a considerable height, and imperfectly
    lighted by small windows, or rather embrasures, perforating a
    wall many feet in thickness. Here they were left to their
    reflections, and to what comfort they could derive fron a lamp
    and a supply of provisions. Hassan, wearied with his journey,
    hastily swallowed his supper, and, stretching himself upon a
    paillasse, soon forgot his calamities in sound repose. Ibrahim,
    more vigilant and less apprehensive of future evil, as the
    Turks and Austrians were then at peace, paced awhile along the
    floor of his spacious prison, musing on the peerless charms of
    the Uzcoque maiden. From time to time he gazed upon the walls
    and windows as if calculating the chances of escape, when
    gradually the peculiar and regular design of the panneling
    caught and fixed his attention. It was divided by prominent
    mouldings into oblong squares, from the centres of which
    projected large diamond-shaped bosses of carved oak. This
    peculiarity at length roused into action some reminiscences of
    the early life and adventures of his beloved patron, the pacha
    of Bosnia, to the recital of which he had often, in his
    boyhood, listened with eager delight. These recollections, at
    first shadowy and indistinct, became gradually more vivid and
    accurate, until finally the full conviction flashed upon him
    that his benefactor, when taken prisoner in his youth by the
    Austrians, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319"
       name="page319"></a>[pg 319]</span> had been confined in this
       very tower and room, and, by a singular discovery, had been
       enabled to liberate himself and his fellow-prisoners. The
       pacha, then a subordinate in rank, in endeavouring to reach
       the level of one of the embrasures, had mounted upon the
       shoulders of a comrade, and was supporting himself by a firm
       grasp of the large boss in the centre of the pannel, when
       suddenly he felt it turning round in his hand. Surprised to
       find it not a fixture, he pulled it towards him, and found
       that it slowly yielded to the impulse. Drawing it out of the
       socket, he saw it followed by an iron chain, which for a
       time resisted all his efforts, but at length gave way, and
       he heard a grating sound like the drawing of a rusty bolt.
       Suddenly the entire pannel shook, and then the lower end
       started back sufficiently to betray a recess in the wall.
       Hastily descending on his comrade's shoulders, and pushing
       back the pannel, he discovered that it was supported by
       hinges, and was doubtless intended to conceal a secret issue
       from the castle, which he soon ascertained, and effected his
       escape. These facts were all that the memory of Ibrahim
       could supply; but they were enough to guide him in his
       search, and he immediately proceeded to sound the pannels in
       succession with his fist. Commencing with the southern or
       outer wall, which he supposed more massive and more likely
       to contain a secret passage, he sounded each pannel, and
       perceiving in the corner one more reverberation than in the
       others, he roused Hassan from his slumbers. "Hassan!
       Hassan!" he exclaimed, "Arouse thee, man! and listen to good
       tidings." The awakened sleeper gazed with half-opened eyes
       upon his excited companion, and would have dropped to sleep
       again had not a few words of explanation and the hope of
       escape fully roused him. Having with some difficulty perched
       his rotund person upon the ample shoulders of Ibrahim, he
       followed his directions and grasped the wooden boss, which,
       to the inexpressible delight of both, yielded, as it had
       done forty years before to the captive Turk, and displayed
       the iron chain. Bidding Hassan replace the boss, Ibrahim
       determined to postpone his attempt until the festival had
       collected all the guards and menials into the central
       edifice and its approaches. An hour before midnight, when
       the young Moslem expected the revelry would be at its
       height, Hassan again mounted upon his shoulders, and after
       many strenuous efforts, at length succeeded in drawing up
       the bolt. The pannel receded some inches, and Ibrahim
       raising it still further, seized the lamp and entered a
       small oblong recess in the wall, which was not less than ten
       or twelve feet in thickness. Perceiving no outlet, he
       examined the wooden flooring, and soon discovered a trap,
       which, when raised by the ring attached, exposed to view a
       steep and narrow descending staircase, leading apparently to
       some sally-port beyond the castle ditch. After carefully
       trimming his lamp, he was about to lead the way into this
       dark abyss, when a sound, sharp and sudden, as of something
       falling in the adjacent prison, caught his ear. Retracing
       his steps, he re-entered the apartment, where, after a brief
       search, he found beneath one of the embrasures a paper
       folded round a large pebble. Hastily opening it, the
       following lines, written in the <i>lingua Franca</i> so
       common in the Levant, were visible.</p>

    <p>"Moslem! If thy soul belie not thy noble form and features,
    thou wilt not withhold thine aid from a bereaved and sorrowing
    daughter. Before to-morrow's sunset thou wilt be free, for
    Austria wars not with the Turk. Then straight repair to Venice,
    and there await the Battle of the Bridge. Take thy stand
    beneath the portal of St Barbara, and follow the man who
    whispers in thine ear,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"STRASOLDA."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Mashallah!" shouted the enraptured youth, "these lines are
    from the Uzcoque maiden; and by the gates of Paradise I'll do
    her bidding, though it perils life."</p>

    <p>For a time he was tempted to follow her guidance implicitly,
    and await the promised release from the authorities of
    Gradiska; recollecting, however, the proverbial slowness of
    Austrian counsellors, and too restless and ardent to endure
    suspense, he resumed his purpose of exploring the secret
    passage. After he had secured the <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page320"
       name="page320"></a>[pg 320]</span> pannel and replaced the
       boss, he bade Hassan follow him and began to descend. The
       staircase ended in a small passage round an angle, beyond
       which he discovered a similar descent, followed by another
       angle and staircase, proving that this secret issue from the
       castle penetrated through each of the four massive walls
       which formed the tower. At length their further progress was
       stopped by a door, originally strong and plated with iron,
       but now so much decayed, that although fastened by bolts
       without, the joint strength of the two captives forced it
       from its hinges. They now entered a vaulted passage of hewn
       stone, low and narrow, and with no visible termination. As
       they advanced, the long pent-up and dank unwholesome vapours
       made it difficult to breathe, and compelled Ibrahim to pause
       repeatedly and trim his lamp, which burned so dimly in this
       oppressive atmosphere as to be nearly extinguished. After a
       while the path began to slope upwards, and erelong they
       distinguished moonlight faintly streaming through a tangled
       mass of ivy which concealed the remains of an iron grating,
       broken probably in his patron's successful attempt to escape
       by this secret passage from the prison above. Gazing through
       the aperture, they perceived not many feet below what had
       once been the castle ditch, now dry, and forming a portion
       of the archduke's gardens. With a joyous heart and an
       elastic bound, Ibrahim reached the soft turf beneath. The
       more timid and helpless Hassan lowered himself by clinging
       to a remaining iron bar, and with the aid of his companion
       was soon on his feet, enjoying, with many thanks to Allah,
       the fresh air of heaven and the consciousness of escape from
       captivity. The gates of the palace gardens being unguarded
       during the festival, the liberated prisoners reached the
       coast without an obstacle, compelled a fisherman to take
       them in his bark across the Adriatic, and land them on the
       Lido, which forms the outward limit of the port of Venice.
       Then making free with an unwatched gondola, they sped across
       the bay, and were soon in safety, beneath the roof of a
       Turkish trader and correspondent of Hassan.</p>

    <p>Before their escape was discovered on the following morning,
    the indignant Proveditore had departed for Venice, and
    Strasolda had disappeared.</p>

    <h2>COLONEL DAVIDSON'S TRAVELS IN INDIA.<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href=
       "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></h2>

    <p>The appearance of this work was heralded some three months
    since, as divers of our readers may possibly remember, by a
    species of puff-preliminary, for which even the annals of Great
    Marlborough Street afforded no precedent&mdash;being nothing
    less than the appearance of Mr Colburn, <i>in propri&acirc;
    person&acirc;</i>, at the bar of the police-office adjoining
    his premises, to answer the complaint of the gallant and irate
    author for what he was pleased to consider the unwarrantable
    detention of the MS. from which his narrative had been printed.
    It was alleged, in extenuation, that "the gallant colonel's MS.
    was so nearly undecipherable, that Mr Colburn had been put to
    considerable expense in revising the press;"&mdash;and a
    mysterious and curiosity-provoking hint was further thrown out,
    that "it was the custom of the trade, that, until a work was
    published, the MS. should not be parted with by the publisher,
    as it might turn out that some part of it was libellous, and in
    such case the publisher must produce the MS." In the end the
    gallant colonel (whom the newspaper reports described as "very
    much excited,") took nothing by his motion in regard to the
    recovery of the MS.; but though in this respect he may have
    been somewhat scurvily treated, we cannot equally sympathize
    with his complaints of the work not having been duly
    <i>advertised</i>; for surely all the little "neatly turned
    paragraphs" that ever proceeded from Mr Colburn's laboratory,
    could not have been so effectual as the method struck out by
    the impromptu genius of the colonel himself, in intimating to
    the public that something quite out of the common way might be
    expected from the forthcoming production thus brought before
    its notice.</p>

    <p>And verily those who have been prepared for a queer volume,
    will not be disappointed in the diary of our choleric and
    corpulent colonel. If ever the assurance, which seems to be
    regarded as indispensable in the preface to works of this
    class, that the author "wrote the following pages purely for
    his own amusement," bore the stamp of unequivocal truth, it is
    in the present instance; and, notwithstanding the asseverations
    of Mr Colburn and his literary employ&eacute;s, it is difficult
    to conceive that any revision whatever can have been bestowed
    on the rough notes of the writer, since they were first hastily
    committed to paper amidst the scenes which they describe. The
    style is as rambling and unconnected as the incidents to which
    it refers; but wherever the author's devious footsteps lead us,
    from the jungles of Bundelcund to the holy gh&acirc;ts of
    Hurdwar, the principal figure is always that of the colonel
    himself, who, in the portly magnificence of twenty stone minus
    two pounds, fills up the whole foreground with himself and his
    accessories of servants, elephant, stud, Nagoree cows, and
    other component parts of the <i>suwarree</i> or suite of a
    <i>Qui-hye</i>, who can afford to make himself comfortable
    after the fashion of the country. The quantity (sometimes not
    trifling) and quality of his meals, the consequent state of his
    digestion, and his endless rows on the score of accommodations
    and forage with thannadars, darogahs, kutwals, and all the
    other designations for Hindoo and Hindoostani jacks-in-office,
    (for to Feringhi society he appears to have been not very
    partial,) may doubtless have been points of peculiar interest
    to the colonel himself, but are not likely to engage the
    attention of the world in general, and had better have been
    omitted in the revision of the diary, instead of being
    chronicled, as they are on all occasions, with wearisome
    minuteness of detail. But with <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page322"
       name="page322"></a>[pg 322]</span> all these drawbacks, a
       man who, as he says of himself, "has dwelt in India
       twenty-five years, and traversed it from the snowy range to
       Bombay on the west, must have seen something of the country,
       and may be supposed to know something of the
       natives"&mdash;among whom, by the way, he seems to have
       mingled more familiarly than most Feringhis; and in spite of
       all the egotism and rigmarole with which his pages abound,
       the rambles of this "stout gentleman" through Upper India,
       and some other parts of the country not much visited by
       Europeans, present us with a good deal of plain sense and
       sterling matter, viewed, it is true, with the eccentric eye
       of a humorist, and frequently couched in very odd
       phraseology; but not the less true on that account. His
       opinions on all men and all things are expressed with the
       same honesty and candour with which he narrates the various
       scrapes in which he was involved, while pushing right a-head
       like an elephant through a jungle;&mdash;and though laughing
       at him quite as often as with him, we have found the
       colonel, on the whole, far from an unpleasant travelling
       companion.</p>

    <p>Bareilly, on the fronters of Oude and Rohilcund, was the
    colonel's starting-point;&mdash;and thence on St Patrick's
    day<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href=
       "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> he set forward for Hurdwar, at
       the head of a retinue, the members of which, both quadruped
       and biped, he enumerates seriatim, giving the <i>pas</i> to
       the former&mdash;a precedence perhaps well merited by steeds
       up to such a welter weight under the climate of India, over
       such a set of unredeemed and thriftless knaves as he
       describes his native attendants. Accordingly, he gives the
       names and pedigrees of the whole stud, from "the buggy mare
       Maiden-head and my wicked little favourite Fish-Guts," up to
       "my favourite brood-mare Fair Amelia, purchased at a prize
       sale on the frontier, and bred by the king of Bokhara, with
       his royal stamp on her near flank&mdash;stands nearly
       fifteen and a half hands high, with magnificent action and
       great show of blood&mdash;had, when taken, four gold rings
       in her nostrils, now removed and replaced by silver, which
       will be stolen by her groom one by one." His first day's
       march was to Futtehgunge, ("the mart of victory," being the
       scene of the memorable battle in 1774, in which the English,
       as the bought allies of the Nawab Shoojah-ed-dowlah,
       defeated and slew the gallant Rohilla chief, Hafez-Rehmut;)
       and here he oracularly announced a discovery in gastronomy,
       of which it would be unpardonable not to give our readers
       the benefit. "I used my farourite condiment, tomata sauce,
       with my beef; and <i>to all who are ignorant</i> of this
       delicious vegetable I may venture to recommend its sauce, as
       at once both wholesome and savoury, if eaten with anything
       but cranberry tart or apple pie!" It is melancholy to
       reflect how often the best efforts of genius are anticipated
       and rendered of no avail. The colonel, when he penned this
       sentence with a heart overflowing with Epicurean
       philanthropy, was evidently unconscious that "chops and
       tomata sauce" were already familiar to the British public
       from the immortal researches of Mr Pickwick!</p>

    <p>Rampore, in the territory of which the colonel now found
    himself, is still a semi-independent state, the Nawab of which
    has a revenue of sixteen lacs of rupees, (&pound;160,000,)
    while the city, being without the pale of English law, is "a
    city of refuge, a very Goshen of robbers, ... the streets are
    crowded with a mob of very handsome, idle, lounging fellows,
    having generally the fullest and finest jet-black beards and
    black mustaches in the world. Many of these were handsomely
    dressed, and many (which struck me as a very curious fact)
    appeared clean!" These were the Pathans and Rohillas, partly
    descended from the original Moslem conquerors of India, and
    partly from those who have more recently migrated from
    Affghanistan and the adjoining countries. The most athletic and
    warlike race among the Indian <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page323"
       name="page323"></a>[pg 323]</span> Mahommedans, and too
       proud of their blood to exercise any profession but that of
       arms, they are found in every town throughout Upper India,
       swaggering about with sword, shield, and matchlock, in the
       retinues of the native princes, and ready to join any
       enterprise, or flock to the standard of any invader, through
       whose means any prospect is afforded of shaking off the
       Feringhi yoke, and resuming their ancient predominance in
       the country which their forefathers won by their swords from
       the idolaters. "They hate us with the most intense
       bitterness, and can any one be surprised at it? We have
       taken their broad lands foot by foot." Few if any of these
       turbulent spirits are found in our European regular native
       army; their dislike to the cumbrous accoutrements and
       awkward European saddles operating equally, perhaps, with
       the severity of the drill and discipline to deter them; but
       they form the strength of the various corps of irregular
       horse&mdash;a force which, of late years, has most
       judiciously been greatly increased in numbers, and the
       uniform dashing bravery of which in the field, strongly
       contrasts with the misconduct of one at least of the regular
       native cavalry regiments in the late Affghan war. "I have
       seen," (says the colonel,) "a lineal descendant of Pathan
       Nawab's serving in the ranks of Hearsay's horse, as a common
       trooper on twenty rupees a-month, out of which he had merely
       to buy and feed his horse, procure clothes, arms, and
       harness, and sustain his hereditary dignity! By his
       commander and his fellow-soldiers he was always addressed by
       his title of Nawab Sahib!"</p>

    <p>The small-pox was committing dreadful ravages in Rampore and
    its neighbourhood; and though vaccination was performed gratis
    at Bareilly, the fatalist prejudices of the natives, even of
    those of rank and education, prevented them from availing
    themselves of the boon. All the instances of the colonel, in
    behalf of a charming little girl, four years old, whose mother
    and sister had already taken the infection, could get from her
    father nothing more than a promise "to think of it! If it's her
    fate&mdash;&mdash;" said he. "'You fool!' said I, in my civil
    way," (and the colonel's <i>brusquerie</i> was here, at least,
    not misplaced,) "'if a man throws himself into the fire or a
    well, or in the path of a tiger, is he without blame?'" Such
    apathy seems almost unaccountable to English minds; but it may
    find a parallel in Lady Chatterton's story of the Irish
    parents, <a id="footnotetag7"
       name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
       "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> who, after refusing to spend
       fourpence in nourishment for a dying child, came in deep
       grief after its death to their employer, to solicit an
       advance of thirty shillings to <i>wake the corpse</i>!
       Perhaps some ingenious systematists might hence deduce a
       fresh argument in favour of the alleged oriental origin of
       the Irish.</p>

    <p>The colonel's next stage was to Moradabad, another Pathan
    city, but under the <i>raj</i> of the Company, where, in a
    visit to a native original, named Meer Mahommed, he was greatly
    delighted by his new friend's introduction of the English word
    <i>swap</i> into a sentence of Hindoostani. And on the 25th he
    reached Dhampore, where the welcome proclamation, "that the new
    moon had been seen," terminated the fast of the Ramazan, to the
    uncontrollable joy of the Mussulmans, who would have been
    subjected to another day's abstinence if it had not been
    perceived till the succeeding evening. The colonel, however,
    slyly remarks, that "it was very odd that the <i>Hindoos</i>
    could not see the new moon," and hints that their imperfection
    of vision was shared by himself, but it was otherwise decided
    by the Faithful; and he proceeded, amid the noisy rejoicings of
    the Moslem feast of <i>Bukra-Eed</i>, (called by the Turks
    Bairam,) by Najeena, the Birmingham of Upper India, to
    Nujeebabad. Here resided, on a pension of 60,000 rupees
    (&pound;6000) a-year from the English government, the Nawab
    Gholam-ed-deen, better known by the nickname of Bumbo Khan, a
    brother of the once famous Rohilla chief Gholam-Khadir. Though
    past eighty years of age, and weighing upwards of twenty stone,
    he had not lost, any more than the equiponderant colonel, his
    taste for the good things of this world; and our
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page324"
       name="page324"></a>[pg 324]</span> traveller, on partaking
       of the Nawab's hospitality, records with infinite zest the
       glories of a peculiar preparation of lamb, called
       <i>nargus</i>, or the narcissus. But, alas! the
       reminiscences of the nargus were less grateful than the
       fruition, and the remorse of the colonel's guilty stomach
       (as poor Theodore Hooke, or some one else, used to call
       indigestion) continued to afflict him all the way to
       Hurdwar; and may probably account, by the consequent
       irritation of his temper, for various squabbles in which he
       was involved on the route.</p>

    <p>The great fair of Hurdwar was in full swing at the colonel's
    arrival, with its vast concourse of Hindoo devotees from all
    parts of India, to whom it is in itself a spot of peculiar
    sanctity, besides lying in the way to the shrine of Gungotree,
    (the source of the Ganges,) in the Himmalaya&mdash;its crowds
    of merchants and adventurers of all sorts, even from Uzbek
    Tartary and the remote regions of Central Asia&mdash;Seiks by
    thousands from the Punjab, with their families&mdash;Affghan
    and Persian horse-dealers&mdash;and numerous grandees, both of
    the Hindoo and Moslem faith, who repair hither as to a scene of
    gaiety and general resort. The colonel found quarters in the
    tent of a friend employed in the purchase of horses for
    government, and seems to have entered with all his heart into
    the humours of the scene; his description of which, and of the
    varied characteristics of the motley groups composing the half
    million of human beings present, is one of the most graphic and
    picturesque sketches in his work. "Huge heaps of assafoetida,
    in bags, from the mountains beyond Cabool&mdash;tons of raisins
    of various sorts&mdash;almonds, pistachio nuts, sheep with four
    or five horns&mdash;Balkh<a id="footnotetag8"
       name="footnotetag8"></a><a href=
       "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> cats, with long silken hair;
       of singular beauty&mdash;faqueers begging, and abusing the
       uncharitable with the grossest and most filthy
       language&mdash;long strings of elderly ladies, proceeding in
       a chant to the priests of the Lingam, to bargain for bodily
       issue&mdash;Gh&acirc;t priests presenting their books for
       the presents and signatures of the European
       visitors&mdash;groups of Hindoos surrounding a Bramin, who
       gives each of them a certificate of his having performed the
       pilgrimage"&mdash;such are a few of the component parts of
       the scene; but the colonel's attention seems to have been
       principally fixed upon the horses, and the tricks of the
       <i>dulals</i> or brokers, to whom the purchase is generally
       confided, it being almost hopeless for an European to make a
       personal bargain with a native dealer. But among the
       greatest curiosities in this way were some
       <i>tortoiseshell</i> ponies&mdash;for we can call them
       nothing else&mdash;a peculiar race from Uzbek Tartary, which
       we never remember to have heard of before. "They were under
       thirteen hands high, and the most curious compound of
       colours and marks that can be imagined. Suppose the animal
       pure, snowy white; cover the white with large, irregular,
       light bay spots through which the white is visible; in the
       middle of these light bay let there be dark bay marbled
       spots; at every six or eight inches plant rhomboidal patches
       of a very dark iron-grey; then sprinkle the whole with dark
       flea-bites! There's a <i>phooldar</i>, ( flower-market,) as
       they call them;" and we agree with the colonel that such an
       animal would be a fortune at Bartlemy fair.</p>

    <p>Among the distinguished visitors to Hurdwar at this season
    of festivity was the noted Begum Sombre, or Sumroo, whose face
    the colonel compares to that of an old Scotch highlander, and
    her person to a sackful of shawls, and who declared "that the
    Duke of Wellington <i>must</i> be at heart a Catholic,
    <i>because</i> he emancipated the Catholics!" He also renewed
    his gastronomic friendship with his friend Bumbo Khan, with
    whom the recollections of past indigestion did not prevent him
    from feasting on <i>mahaseer</i>, a delicious fish found in
    this part of the Ganges; and on this occasion his Apician
    ecstasies are not alloyed by subsequent regrets&mdash;"even now
    the recollection soothes me"&mdash;and he recommends
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page325"
       name="page325"></a>[pg 325]</span> such of his readers as
       are yet ignorant of this luxury to start forthwith for
       Hurdwar and repair the omission. The fair ended April 13;
       and the colonel having previously succeeded in disposing of
       his buggy to a potentate whom he calls "the Kheerea
       Thunnasir Rajah," (we believe, the ruler of one of the Seik
       protected states,) and buying a stout Turcomani pony for the
       hills, started the same day on the road to Suharunpoor. He
       favours his readers, <i>en passant</i>, with some
       exceedingly original speculations touching the Mosaic
       deluge, in reference to the hills about Hurdwar, which do
       not speak very highly for his attainments in geology, though
       in some other branches of natural history, and particularly
       in botany, he appears to be no mean proficient. The journey
       was disturbed by attempts to steal the colonel's new
       purchase, (which was not, like the rest of the stud,
       distinguished from the horses of the country by having its
       tail cut,) and by a quarrel at Secunderpore with a
       thannadar, or native police magistrate, whose European
       superior's neglect of the colonel's complaint he charitably
       attributes to "some (I hope slight) derangement of the
       stomach." At Suharunpore he visited the well-known botanist
       Dr Royle, the curator of the Company's botanic garden there,
       then engaged in those labours on the Flora of the Himmalayas
       which have been since given to the world; and at Boorea,
       leaving the British territory, he entered that of the
       protected Seik states, whose petty chieftains are secured in
       their semi-independence by the treaty with Runjeet in 1809,
       which confined the ruler of Lahore to the right bank of the
       Sutlej. But their reception of the colonel did not appear to
       indicate any great degree of gratitude for these favours to
       the British nation, as represented in his person; for not
       one of the five Seik chiefs, "each of whom has his own snug
       little fort close to the city," would supply him with a
       lodging; and it was only by perseverance and ingenuity that
       he secured a place to lay his head, after long wrangling
       with the subordinate functionaries. Matters improved,
       however, as he advanced further into the country; and, at
       the little mountain-city of Nahun, he was most hospitably
       received and entertained by the young rajah, Futteh Pur
       Grass Sing, "who had been educated almost entirely under the
       kind and fatherly superintendence of Captain Murray," the
       commissioner of the Seik states, and whose frank and
       gentlemanlike manners, "so unlike those of the ghee-fed
       wretches of the plains," did honour to his guardian's
       precepts. The town of Nahun, which is 3600 feet above the
       level of the sea, is described as clean and well paved; and
       the rajah, whose revenue had been increased under the
       management of Captain Murray from 37,000 to 53,000 rupees,
       was highly popular, and by the colonel's account deservedly
       so, with his subjects. He earnestly pressed "the fat
       gentleman" (whose caution in mounting an elephant, while two
       men on the other side of the howdah balanced his weight,
       vehemently excited his risibility) to return to the plains
       through Nahun, and have a month's shooting with him in the
       valley; but whether the invitation was accepted or not
       remains untold, as&mdash;"Alas for the literature of the
       age! when I was ordered to Bundelcund, a vile thief entered
       my tents at night, and robbed me of my second volume; and
       thus did I lose my carefully written account of the
       sub-Himmalayan range, which cost me fully eight months'
       labour."</p>

    <p>Thus abruptly terminates the first part of the colonel's
    travels, and at the commencement of the second we find him
    crossing the Jumna to Calpee, the frontier town of Bundelcund,
    a wild and unsettled province, prolific in Thugs and bad
    characters of all sorts, and principally inhabited by a
    peculiar race called Bundelas, who have never been perfectly
    reconciled to the British supremacy, and who, at this present
    writing, are kept quiet only by the presence of a force of
    15,000 men. Calpee is said to be the hottest place in India,
    the thermometer in June, according to the colonel, standing
    even on a cloudy day at 145 degrees&mdash;a degree of heat
    almost incredible; and it is also the principal mart for the
    cotton, which the rich black soil of Bundelcund produces of
    finer quality than any other part of Hindostan. But,
    notwithstanding its commercial inportance, the town was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page326"
       name="page326"></a>[pg 326]</span> at this time left to the
       government of a native Darogah or chief of police, the
       nearest European courts being at Hameerpore, thirty miles
       distant, and the state of society seems to have been
       somewhat singular. Among its most conspicuous members is
       "Gopal, the celebrated robber, murderer, and smuggler, a
       tall athletic man about forty-two years of age, with a most
       hideous muddy eye, having the glare of hell itself. It is
       said that he has always fifteen servants in stated pay, and
       can in a few hours command the services of three hundred
       armed and desperate men; and the strength and vigour of the
       Calpee police may be estimated by the fact, that he has been
       known to walk into the house of a rich merchant in the
       centre of the town, when he was surrounded by his servants
       and family; he has very coolly selected the gold bangles of
       his children, and silenced the trembling remonstrances of
       the Mahajun by threats of vengeance; nor is this a solitary
       instance. When he murders, he is equally above all
       concealment; as in the recent case of a sepahee returning
       home with his savings, who was waylaid and murdered by our
       hero in open day. He very coolly gave himself up,
       acknowledging that he had killed the sepahee, who had first
       assaulted him. It was proved on the trial, that the sepahee
       was wholly unarmed, and he was condemned to be hung by the
       court of Hameerpore on his own confession, but released,
       <i>from want of evidence</i>, by the Sudder Court at
       Calcutta. Their objection was excellent, though curious;
       that if his confession was taken, it must be taken
       altogether, and not that part only which could lead to his
       conviction. He was released, and now walks about in his
       Sunday clothes, a living evidence of British
       tenderness."</p>

    <p>Gopal was not the only amiable character with whom the
    colonel became acquainted at Calpee, as he sought and obtained
    an interview with a famous Thug approver, who had retired from
    the active exercise of his profession, and was travelling the
    country in company with a party of police, denouncing his
    former associates to justice. We cannot help suspecting, both
    from the traits recorded of him, and from the vicinity of
    Calpee to his former residence at Jalone, that this personage
    was no other than the celebrated Ameer Ali, whose adventures
    formed the ground of Captain Meadows Taylor's well-known
    "Confessions of a Thug;" and as a pendant to the already
    published descriptions of him, we here quote the impression he
    made upon the colonel. "I expected to see a great man, but at
    the first glance I saw that I was in the presence of a master.
    The Thug was tall, active, and slenderly formed; his head was
    nearly oval; his eye most strongly resembled that of a cobra di
    capello; its dart was perfectly wild and maniacal, restless,
    brilliant, metallic, and concentrated." The colonel had a
    narrow escape from irretrievably affronting this eminent
    professor of murder, by unguardedly enquiring whether he was in
    any way cognizant of a trifling robbery by which the colonel
    himself had been a sufferer. "No, sir!" he exclaimed with a
    look which might have frozen a less innocent querist; "murder,
    not robbery, is my profession ... and none but the merest
    novices would descend so low as to rob a tent or a
    dwelling-house." The colonel, however, expresses a shrewd
    suspicion, from circumstances which had come to his knowledge,
    that his distinguished visitor's <i>esprit de corps</i> led him
    to deviate from truth in this particular&mdash;a belief in
    which Captain Taylor's pages fully bear him out.</p>

    <p>The colonel's movements, after quitting Calpee and its
    attractive circles, appear to have been somewhat desultory. We
    find him, successively, at Murgaon or Murgong, Julalpore,
    Keitah, &amp;c., without being told what decided his route; but
    from some subsequent remarks, it appears probable that he was
    engaged on engineering service by order of Government. Between
    Julalpore and Keitah he fell in with a gang of <i>nutts</i>
    <a id="footnotetag9"
       name="footnotetag9"></a><a href=
       "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> or <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page327"
       name="page327"></a>[pg 327]</span> gipsies, whom the beauty
       of their women (a point to which the colonel is always
       alive) did not prevent him from suspecting of an intention
       to practise <i>thuggee</i> on his own portly person&mdash;a
       belief in which he was confirmed by hearing them speak <i>in
       another tongue</i> among themselves&mdash;no doubt the
       <i>Ramasee</i>, or cant language of the Thugs, subsequently
       made known to the world at large by the investigations of
       Major Sleeman. At Goraree he purchased some small cups,
       carved from the variegated serpentine of the rock on which
       the town is built; but, on proposing to employ the artist in
       making some larger vases, "he told me that he was a very
       poor man, and his efforts had never been directed to larger
       patterns; meaning to infer that it was impossible he could
       either try or succeed!" Such is Hindoo nature!</p>

    <p>Churkaree, the capital of Ruttun Sing Buhadoor, one of the
    principal of the numerous rajahs among whom Bundelcund is
    divided, is described as "prettily situated on the side of the
    hill, over a lake covered with the white lotus flower, and
    having a very fine appearance from a distance, as most of the
    houses have their upper stories whitewashed, and are seen
    peeping through the dark-green leafy trees of the country, but
    the town, which contains perhaps 15,000 souls, of whom 1000 may
    be Mussulmen, is very straggling, irregular, and dirty." The
    male population were all fiercely mustached, and loaded with
    arms; but their repulsive exterior was more than compensated by
    the charms of the other sex, all of whom wore immense hollow
    ankle bangles of zinc, filled with bits of gravel, which
    tinkled as they walked. "I have never seen so many well-formed
    and handsome women together as I did at the wells outside the
    town, drawing water <i>&agrave; la Rebecca</i>. Some of their
    faces were strikingly intelligent, and their figures eminently
    graceful. The population is almost purely Hindoo; and I think
    the Hindoo females are more delicate in their forms than the
    Mussulmanees." The Rajah was, however, absent on a sporting
    excursion, and the darogah refused to provide the colonel with
    lodgings, alleging his master's orders that no Feringhis should
    be allowed in the town; and it was not till after a long
    altercation, of which the colonel gives himself greatly the
    best, that he succeeded in finding quarters in the house of a
    <i>bunneea</i> or grocer. But the next day's march (for
    Bundelcund is almost as thickly set with sovereign princes as
    Saxony itself) carried him out of the realm of this
    inhospitable potentate into the territories of the Rajah of
    Jalone, the once noted patron and protector of Thuggee, by
    whose agent he was most politely received at Mahoba, a once
    splendid but now ruined city, celebrated for its artificial
    lakes, which in long-past times were formed by a famous Rajpoot
    prince named Purmal, by damming up the narrow gorges of the
    hills. "Never had I seen, in the plains of India, a prospect
    more enchanting! Conceive a beautiful sheet of calm, clear,
    silvery water, of several miles in circumference, occasionally
    agitated by the splashing leaps of large fishes, or the gradual
    alighting of noble swan-like aquatic birds: its margin broken
    as if by the most skilful artist; now running into the centre,
    and ending in most romantic low rocky hills, covered with trees
    and embellished with black, antique Jain temples, deserted
    probably for hundreds of years, and at present the retreat of
    the elegant peafowl; in other places embanked with huge blocks
    of cut granite, embrowned by the shade of magnificent trees,
    under which small bright Hindoo temples, carefully whitewashed,
    might be seen in the shade; or bounded by abrupt rocky
    promontories, surmounted by many-pillared temples in ruins,
    hanging in the sky. A fine rich sunset gave an exquisite
    richness and classic magnificence to the scene. Many little
    boys with rod and line were ensnaring the sweet little
    <i>singhee</i>, or the golden <i>rohoo</i> or
    carp&mdash;bringing back to my heart the days, when, stealing
    from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page328"
       name="page328"></a>[pg 328]</span> school, I was wont to sit
       on the rocks of the Dee, at Craglug, near Aberdeen, watching
       the motion of a float that was not under water once in the
       twenty-four hours."</p>

    <p>The colonel's laudable habit of associating freely, whenever
    opportunity occurred, with the natives, gave him considerable
    insight into the state of the country, where the caprices of
    the native princes were not then much interfered with, and
    which consequently, as he says, "was pretty much in the
    situation of the Emerald Isle;" and verily if the tale told him
    by the Hindoo <i>gosain</i> or priest at Jour&acirc;ho&ocirc;,
    of the murder of his predecessor in the temple, and the
    impunity of the robbers, were correctly related, the Bundelas
    have not much to learn in the arts of bloodshed and
    depredation. "This village being a sort of corner to the
    territories of several Rajahs, robberies, murders, and all
    other diversions, are of daily occurrence; and when enquiries
    are made; each territory throws the blame on its neighbour."
    The maxim of government most current in Bundelcund, both with
    rulers and ruled, seems indeed to have been&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The good old rule, the simple plan,</p>

            <p>That those should take who have the power,</p>

            <p>And those should keep who can;"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>for while this strange confusion of <i>meum</i> and
    <i>tuum</i> prevailed among the peasantry, the country was
    ruined by the oppressive and irregular exactions of the rajahs,
    both zemindars and cultivators flying from their habitations to
    escape the levying of the rents, which were often demanded more
    than once by different collectors. At Chundla, the colonel was
    lodged in the house of an opulent zemindar, who had absconded
    for the reason just given; "and one of the thanna servants told
    me, that, by those means, Bundelcund was depopulated"&mdash;a
    statement corroborated by the numerous ruined brick houses
    remaining in the towns among the miserable hovels of the
    present day. The rajahs of Bundelcund are, almost without
    exception, of Rajpoot lineage, and thus of a different race
    from their Bundela subjects; but the condition of the country
    is much the same wherever it is left under the sway of the
    Hindoo princes, who are exempt even from the partial restraint
    which the Koran imposes on the despotism of Mahommedan rulers.
    The only effectual cure for the evils reigning in Bundelcund
    will be its formal incorporation with the dominions of the
    Company&mdash;a consummation which, from the refractory spirit
    shown in the province after our losses in Affghanistan, is
    probably not far distant.</p>

    <p>The remainder of the colonel's notes on Bundelcund relate
    principally to his visits to the ancient hill-fortresses of
    Ajeegur and Kalingur, both formerly occupied in force by the
    British, but now&mdash;with the exception of a havildar's
    (sergeant's) party of sepoys posted at the former, and a single
    company at the latter&mdash;garrisoned solely by the
    <i>lungoors</i>, or large black monkeys, whom the colonel found
    holding solemn assembly in the Jain temples and the hall of
    audience, built by the famous Rajah Purmal at Ajeegur. While
    exploring his way along the ruined and overgrown ramparts, he
    had a narrow escape from the fangs of a large venomous serpent,
    ("the <i>Katula Rekula Poda</i>, No. 7 of Russell,") on which
    he was on the point of treading, and which, in commendable
    gratitude for its forbearance; he allowed to glide off unharmed
    by his fowling-piece; "but he was the first reptile that ever
    escaped without the chance of losing his life at my hands." On
    the road to Kalingur he had an interview with a petitioner, who
    offered him 400 rupees in cash, or a large diamond, for his
    interest in a certain case then pending before the judge at
    Bandah; "but I explained to my client that I was not in that
    line of business, and as I saw he had no intention of insulting
    me, we parted friends." Kalingur, which was taken by the
    British after a long siege in 1812, stands on a rock towering
    "upwards of 850 feet above the plain below, and probably about
    3000 feet above the level of the sea;" but its strength as a
    fortress is as nothing in comparison to its sanctity, which
    entitles every one, who resides there only as long as it takes
    to milk a cow, to especial beatitude&mdash;the object of
    veneration being a <i>lingam</i> of black stone enshrined in a
    temple, the guardianship of which is <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page329"
       name="page329"></a>[pg 329]</span> jointly vested in five
       resident families of Bramins. "At this time," says the
       colonel, "the place is not worth keeping, the country being
       so thoroughly impoverished and desolate;" and he
       accordingly, after viewing the marvels of the locality,
       pursued his way to Banda, and thence <i>laid a d&acirc;k</i>
       (or travelled by palanquin with relays of bearers) to
       Calpee, "there to sit from nine to four, writing filthy
       accounts of bricks and mortar, square feet, cubic feet, and
       running feet, rupees, annas, and pie; squabbling with
       wrinkled unromantic villains, whose cool-tempered and
       overwhelming patience amply deserve their unlawful
       gains&mdash;I mean as labourers in the vineyard of
       villany."</p>

    <p>"A sporting excursion in Oude," in the spring of 1836, comes
    next in order of time; and in regular order we accordingly take
    it, though it has pleased either Mr Colburn or the colonel to
    place it after the voyage down the Ganges. The colonel left
    Lucknow, March 2; and three days later the whole party
    rendezvoused at Khyrabad, consisting of "Mrs, Miss, and
    Brigadier Churchill, Colonel Arnold, Major Cureton, Lieut.
    Waugh, Dr Ross of her Majesty's 16th Lancers, and the writer of
    these amiable records;" to whom was soon after added, in the
    capacity of guide and hanger-on, "Sam Lall, by birth a Chuttree
    or Rajpoot, by profession a zemindar, and by inclination a
    sycophant and shikarree, (hunter.)" Indian field sports, with
    their concomitants of hogs, hogdeer, jungles, elephants,
    tigers, and nullahs, have been of late years rendered so
    familiar to stay-at-home travellers, that we shall but
    concisely notice the colonel's exploits in this forest
    campaign, which present no remarkable novelty, though detailed
    <i>con amore</i>, and with the two-fold zest of a sportsman and
    an epicure. With all deference, indeed, to the colonel, we have
    shrewd doubts whether the latter feeling was not the
    predominant one; for the death of a tiger, nine of which fell
    during the three weeks' foray before the rifles of himself and
    his companions, is evidently chronicled with less of heart-felt
    enthusiasm than characterises his encomiums on the hogdeer
    soup, the delicate floricans and black partridges, (in the
    preparation of bread sauce, for which, with his own hands, he
    earned immortal renown,) and the other materials for good
    living poured forth from the cornucopia of an Indian game-bag.
    His gastronomic fervour during this jaunt reaches at times an
    ecstatic pitch, which, as old Weller says, "werges on the
    poetical." "For him (the gastronomist) the dark rocks and arid
    plains of the dry Dekkan produce their purple grapes, and
    cunning but goodly bustard; for him burning Bundelcund its
    wonderful rock pigeon and ortolan inimitable; the Jumna, most
    ancient of rivers, its large rich Kala banse, and tasty crabs;
    for him yields the low and marshy Terace her elegant florican;
    the mighty Gunga its melting mahaseer; the Goomtee its
    exquisite mullet. And shall he not eat and delight in her
    fruits? ... Let the ass eat its thistles, and the swallow its
    flies <i>au naturel</i>; you and I, reader, know better!"</p>

    <p>One day, while wading on their elephants through a deep
    marsh in pursuit of a tiger, the chasseurs suddenly stumbled
    upon a pleasant family party&mdash;"a labyrinth of huge
    boa-constrictors or pythons, sound asleep, floating on a bed of
    crushed <i>nurkool</i>, (a gigantic species of reed,) the least
    of them twenty feet long, and two feet in circumference. A more
    beautiful natural mosaic cannot be imagined: they appeared,
    from being wet, as if recently varnished. Perhaps they were
    from twenty to thirty in number, and occupied a spot of about
    twenty feet square. No sooner did the dreadful glistening
    reptiles hear the click of my rifle, and feel its ball, than
    they shot forth with all their vigour, and diving, disappeared
    in an instant under the matted roots of the tall nurkool, and,
    although I tried, I could not get another glimpse." One of
    these giant serpents, seventeen feet long, and eighteen inches
    in circumference, which the colonel calls a small one, was shot
    a few days afterwards by Colonel Arnold. The marsh and jungle
    swarmed with peacocks, jungle-fowl, and wild-fowl of all sorts,
    affording glorious sport; and, besides the smaller kinds of
    deer, several specimens occurred of a magnificent species of
    stag with twelve-tyned horns, called
    <i>baru-singa</i>&mdash;apparently allied to <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page330"
       name="page330"></a>[pg 330]</span> the <i>sambur</i> and
       <i>rusa</i> of the Dekkan. The comparatively small number of
       tigers killed was, however, a source of disappointment;
       since the utility of these battues, in which the superior
       fire-arms and appliances of the English are brought into
       action for the destruction of these ferocious animals, may
       be estimated from the damage done by them in the wilder
       parts of India, "which is beyond the belief even of
       Indo-European residents, and must, consequently, appear an
       exaggeration to distant Englishmen. General (then Captain)
       Briggs, when resident at Dhoolia in Candeish, in 1821, where
       his potails, or head men, were obliged to keep a register of
       the oxen (exclusive of sheep and goats) destroyed in their
       villages, reported that no less than 21,000 had been killed
       in three years! As no register is kept in Oude, it is
       impossible to register the number."</p>

    <p>On the banks of the Mohun-nuddee the party was joined by
    Rajah Ruttun Sing, a chief holding a considerable tract of
    country under the suzeraint&eacute; of Oude, who favoured them
    with his company while they remained in his district&mdash;a
    compliment which he expected to be acknowledged, as he
    distinctly intimated on taking leave, by the gift of a valuable
    fowling-piece; but this modest request was parried by the
    rejoinder, that none of their guns were good enough for his
    highness! During one of the halts, an incident occurred which
    strongly illustrates the inhuman apathy of the Hindoos towards
    any one not connected with them by the ties of caste. A man was
    found sitting under a tree near the camp, uttering strange
    cries, and the servants were desired to order him to withdraw;
    "they returned, saying carelessly that he was a <i>nutt</i>, or
    gipsy, who had been robbed." A robbery <i>from</i> a gipsy was
    such a strange contradiction of terms, that the colonel went
    personally to enquire into the matter, when he was
    horror-struck by finding, that the man had been, not only
    plundered of his earnings by a band of Bunjarras, but
    frightfully mutilated and wounded, a trifle which the Hindoo
    servants had not thought worth mentioning. The poor wretch's
    arm was amputated by Dr Ross; and, being carried with the camp
    and carefully tended, he was at last dismissed, with a fair
    prospect of recovery, and with a gift of sixty rupees
    subscribed among the party; but not even the example of the
    <i>sahibs</i> could teach the Hindoos humanity, and only the
    peremptory commands of Dr Ross could prevail upon his bearer to
    place a mattress under the sufferer! On their return march, the
    party were further honoured by visits from several rajahs and
    zemindars, all of whom were "loud in complaint against the
    extortions of the aumils, who constantly attempted to gather
    more, and sometimes twice and a half as much, as the stipulated
    rent, in consequence of which the zemindars were compelled to
    rebel;" a view of the political condition of Oude which
    naturally results from its anomalous position, under a
    sovereign nominally independent, who is at once too weak to
    control his own subjects, and fearful of diminishing the shadow
    of authority left to him by calling in the only available aid.
    On the 29th of March the party again reached Khyrabad, the
    appointed place of their separation, as it had been of their
    meeting; and here the narrative, as before, breaks off
    abruptly.</p>

    <p>The concluding part, in order of time, of the colonel's
    lucubrations, contains his narrative of a voyage on the Ganges,
    from Allahabad, by Dhacca, to Calcutta; but the features and
    incidents of this navigation have been so frequently described
    by travellers of all sorts and kinds, from Bishop Heber and
    Captain Bellew to our own much-esteemed Kerim Khan, that we
    shall devote but brief space to it. He quitted Allahabad, as he
    informs us, December 5, 1839, so deeply regretted by the native
    population, that they determined to perpetuate his memory by
    the erection of a new gh&acirc;t or landing-place, every brick
    of which was to be stamped with the letter D&mdash;a
    distinction which he had, no doubt, deserved by the
    <i>bonhommie</i> towards both Hindoo and Moslem, which forms
    one of the most favourable traits in the jovial colonel's
    character. The Tribeenee Gh&acirc;t, immediately below
    Allahabad, where the streams of the Jumna and the Ganges unite,
    is one of the holiest spots in India; to which pilgrims
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page331"
       name="page331"></a>[pg 331]</span> resort from all quarters,
       in the hope of securing paradise by dying at the junction of
       the sacred waters. The spirit of religious exclusiveness
       prevails here as well as in other places; and the colonel
       mentions his having been once an eyewitness of some rough
       treatment received by a <i>chumar</i>, or leather-dresser,
       (one of the lowest castes,) at the hands of some high caste
       sepoys, who were highly indignant that so mean a carcass
       should presume to defile the holy ground! Leaving the
       gh&acirc;ts and devotees behind him, however, and floating
       down the stream in his capacious three-roomed budgerow, he
       passed Mirzapoor, Chunar, and even the holy city of Benares,
       (which he perversely spells Bunarus,) without halting; and
       reached without adventure or mishap the mouth of the
       Goomtee, where his attention was attracted by a party of
       eighteen young elephants, the property of the king of Oude,
       bathing in the river. "Of all animals, saving the Bundela
       goat, there is none that suffers more from change of climate
       than the elephant: of the numbers caught on the eastern
       frontier, probably not one in four survives a journey to
       Delhi. Bred in the darkest and most gloomy forests, they are
       in a great measure sheltered from heat by the eternal
       moisture of the cool shady bower under which they rove; and
       are then expected to bear all on a sudden the most intense
       heat, acting directly on their jet-black skins, when brought
       into the plains of Upper India. A very clever native told me
       he could make money by any thing but young elephants."
       Another curious fact relative to the elephant, mentioned in
       a subsequent chapter on the authority of Captain Broadfoot
       of the Madras commissariat, is, that both wild and tame
       elephants are extremely subject to a pulmonary disease,
       which proved on dissection to be tubercular&mdash;in fact,
       consumption! It was found to yield, however, to copious
       bleedings, if taken in its early stages.</p>

    <p>The colonel's pages, at this point, are filled with
    digressions and dissertations on subjects somewhat
    miscellaneous&mdash;Aberdeen pale ale&mdash;the enormities of
    Warren Hastings' government&mdash;the late James Prinsep and
    the moral precepts of the Rajah Piy&acirc;d&acirc;see&mdash;and
    a most incomprehensible rhapsody about "a red mustached member
    of the Bengal civil service," of which we profess ourselves
    utterly incompetent to make either head or tail, and strongly
    recommend the colonel to expunge it if the work reaches another
    edition. The voyage presents no incidents but the usual ones of
    pelicans, alligators, and porpoises: and on January 15, he
    arrived at Dhacca, "the once famous city of muslins." But the
    muslin trade has now almost wholly disappeared; and with it
    "the thousands of families of muslin weavers, who, from the
    extreme delicacy of their manufacture, were obliged to work in
    pits, sheltered from the heat of the sun and changes of the
    weather; and even after that precaution, only while the dew lay
    on the ground, as the increasing heat destroyed the extremely
    delicate thread." The jungle is in consequence advancing close
    upon the city, which is thus rendered almost uninhabitable from
    malaria&mdash;the only manufacturers which continue to flourish
    being those of violins, bracelets, made from a peculiar shell
    resembling the <i>Murex tulipa</i>, and&mdash;idols for Hindoo
    worship!</p>

    <p>The colonel remained at Dhacca till February 4, awaiting
    ulterior orders from headquarters, and had, consequently,
    abundance of leisure for making himself acquainted with the
    place and its people. These researches, however, were not
    always unattended with danger; for on one occasion, while
    viewing the city from an elevated building, a piece of plaster
    was struck from the cornice near where he stood by a matchlock
    ball&mdash;a delicate hint that the Mussulmans disliked being
    overlooked. The Nawab, apparently the son of Bishop Heber's
    acquaintance, Shumseddowlah, still resides in the palace of his
    ancestors, but is described as an extravagant, uneducated
    youth, who has mortgaged away his income from 5000 to 200
    rupees per mensem&mdash;that is, from L.6000 to L.240 per
    annum. The inhabitants were a mixture of almost all the creeds
    and nations of Asia&mdash;Chinese, Thibetans, Mugs from
    Arracan, Burmese, Malays, etc.; but the great majority are
    Hindoos, whose sanguinary goddess Kalee is adored
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page332"
       name="page332"></a>[pg 332]</span> in not less than fifty
       temples. The Greeks and Armenians also have each a church,
       the services of which, as described by the colonel, are
       conducted in much the same form as at
       Constantinople:&mdash;"But among the (Armenian) matrons only
       was any appearance of devotion visible; one of them, most
       gorgeously appareled in the Armenian fashion, with a
       magnificent tiara of jewels on her brow, and wearing a
       superb shawl, threw herself on the ground, with her head
       sunk between her arms, towards the altar, and remained in
       that position nearly five minutes. The others, being dressed
       <i>&agrave; l'Anglaise</i>, with stiff stays and fashionable
       bonnets, could not afford to indulge in such a position."
       The Armenians were formerly numerous in Dhacca, and are
       still an influential and wealthy body; the Greeks are now
       "few and far between," but in the palmy days of Dhacca they
       were a flourishing community.</p>

    <p>Dhacca was a place abounding in strange characters from all
    parts of the world; and among others whom the colonel
    encountered, was a singular specimen of a cosmopolite, a native
    of Fez, who called himself a Moslem, but whom our friend
    vehemently suspected of being a Jew. He had been almost as
    great a traveller as his countryman the famous Sheikh Ebn
    Batuta, whose wanderings are immortalized in the pages of
    Maga,<a id="footnotetag10"
       name="footnotetag10"></a><a href=
       "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> and came last from Moulmein,
       with a cargo of black pepper and rubies. He had resided
       seventeen years in India, and proposed to the colonel, whom
       he claimed as a brother, "since from his own home he could
       reach England in ten days," that they should jointly freight
       a vessel with valuables, and go <i>home</i> together! And,
       among other scattered facts, a casual encounter with some
       Chinese in the employ of the Assam Tea Company, whom the
       colonel considerably astonished by addressing them in their
       own language, introduces "the very curious fact," that at
       Tipperah, a civil station not more than fifty or sixty miles
       from Dhacca, the natives have from time immemorial used the
       tea which grows there abundantly, and is prepared after a
       fashion of their own. "And yet" (continues the
       colonel&mdash;and we fear there is too much truth in his
       remarks) "the existence of the tea-plant is but a recent
       discovery! Any other nation would have established a
       tea-manufactory at Tipperah, immediately after the first
       settlement, and the Yankees would have 'progressed'
       railroads and steam-boats for its success. India is at this
       moment a mine of unexplored wealth. No sooner had
       steam-boats appeared than coal has been discovered in every
       direction!" The manufacture of native iron in Bengal, which
       had been pressed upon Lord Hastings, as the colonel seems to
       imply, by himself, and at first warmly adopted by him, was
       objected to in the council, and ultimately abandoned, "on
       the grounds that it would militate against the commercial
       interests of Great Britain&mdash;that is, against the
       profits of those India stockholders, possessing votes, who
       followed the trade of ironmongers!" There is many a true
       word spoken in jest; and this and other side-cuts of the
       colonel at the shortsighted proceedings of the Bahadurs at
       Calcutta, though sometimes queerly worded, contain now and
       then some unpalatable facts. The administration of the
       present Governor-General has shown at least some
       <i>promise</i> of a better state of things&mdash;and if the
       impulse now given to the development of the resources of
       India be steadily followed up, this reproach will erelong be
       taken away. The receipt of his final orders, however, which
       pointed out China as his destination, put an end to the
       colonel's speculations; and re-embarking on the stream of
       the Booree Gunga, he passed, with little incident worth
       noticing, through the numerous branches of the river, and
       the picturesque jungles of the Soonderbunds, and arrived
       safely, after an absence of twenty-one years, at the city of
       palaces&mdash;and there we leave him.</p>

    <p>The subject of the manufactures and products of India, is
    not, however, the only point connected with the internal
    administration, respecting <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page333"
       name="page333"></a>[pg 333]</span> which some inconvenient
       facts find their way to light in the colonel's
       pages&mdash;and with one or two of these revelations, we
       shall conclude our extracts. The majority of those
       Anglo-Indian employ&eacute;s, who have favoured the world
       with "Reminiscences" and "Narratives," are singularly free
       from the charge of what is familiarly termed "telling tales
       out of school." According to their account, nowhere is
       justice so efficiently administered, or its functionaries so
       accessible, as in our Indian empire; but here, whether from
       the native frankness of the colonel's disposition, or from
       his having nothing more to hope or fear from the old Begum
       in Leadenhall Street, we find this important subject placed,
       on several occasions, in rather a different light from that
       in which it is usually represented. It is well known that
       Sir David Ochterlony, a short time before his death,
       discovered by mere accident that he was enrolled as a
       pensioner to a large amount on the civil list of almost
       every native prince in Upper India, from the emperor of
       Delhi downwards&mdash;his principal moonshee, or native
       secretary, having thrown out intelligible hints, as though
       from his master, that such douceurs would not be without
       their use in securing his powerful interest at
       Calcutta&mdash;the moonshee himself quietly pocketing the
       proceeds. This was certainly an outrageous instance; but it
       is the direct interest of every native subordinate to screen
       his own misdeeds and extortions, by promoting to the utmost,
       in his European superior, that inaccessibility to which he
       is naturally but too much inclined&mdash;and the extent to
       which this system of exclusion is carried, may be inferred
       from the following anecdote. The colonel had been requested
       by a native landholder of high respectability, to introduce
       him to the house of a civilian; and on asking why he could
       not go by himself, was told, "I dare not approach the very
       compound of the house he lives in! If his head man should
       hear that I ventured to present myself before the gentleman
       without his permission, he would immediately harass me by
       some false complaint, or even by instituting an enquiry into
       the very title-deeds of my estate, which might, however
       falsely, terminate in my ruin. It is not long since I paid
       eleven hundred rupees to &mdash;&mdash; to suppress false
       claims, which, if they had actually gone into court, would
       have cost me ten times the sum."</p>

    <p>Of the practical effects of criminal punishments, the
    colonel does not speak more highly. "In the real Hindoostanee
    view of the subject, a convict in chains is nearly a native
    gentleman&mdash;a little rou&eacute;, perhaps&mdash;employed on
    especial duties in the Company's service, for which he is well
    fed, and has little labour. A jail-bird can easily be
    distinguished after the first six months, by his superior
    bodily condition. On his head maybe seen either a kinkh&acirc;b
    (brocade) or embroidered cap, or one of English flowered
    muslin, enriched with a border of gold or silver lace. Gros de
    Naples is coming into fashion, but slowly.... Was he
    low-spirited, he could, for a trifling present, send to the
    bazar, and enjoy a nautah from the hour the judge went to sleep
    till daybreak next morning&mdash;nay, under proper management,
    he might be gratified by the society of his wife and family....
    See him at work, the burkandauze (policeman) is smoking
    <i>his</i> chillum, while he and his friends are sound asleep,
    <i>sub tegmine fagi</i>. All of a sudden there is an
    alarm&mdash;the judge is coming! up they all start, and work
    like devils for ten or fifteen seconds, and then again to
    repose. This is working in chains on the roads! In fact, after
    a man is once used to the comforts of an Indian prison, there's
    no keeping him out!"</p>

    <p>All this, no doubt, is broad caricature&mdash;but "ridentem
    dicere verum quid vetat?" a motto which the colonel could not
    do better than adopt for any future edition of his eccentric
    lucubrations. And so Rookhsut! Colonel Sahib! may your
    favourite tomata sauce never pall upon your palate; and though
    perhaps you would hardly thank us for the usual oriental good
    wish, that your shadow may continue to increase, may it at
    least never be diminished by that worst of all fiends,
    indigestion!</p>

    <h2>BELFRONT CASTLE.</h2>

    <h3>A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW.</h3>

    <p>One half of the world was surprised that Reginald Belfront
    married Jane Holford&mdash;and the other half was equally
    surprised that Jane Holford married Reginald Belfront; for,
    considering the experience that both halves of the world must
    have had, it is amazing how subject they still are to surprise.
    To us, who have not the pleasure to belong to either half,
    there is very little surprising in the matter. Reginald had
    been for some time on a visit at the house of a distant
    relation&mdash;old Sir Hugh de Mawley. He had wandered through
    the great woods of the estate, and found them very tiresome;
    had strolled in the immense park, and found it dull; and, in
    the long evenings, had sat in the stately hall, and listened to
    the endless, whispered anecdotes of his host, and found them
    both intolerable. No wonder he started with joyful surprise
    when, one day in the drawing-room, he heard the rustle of a
    silk gown; caught the glancing of some beautiful real flowers
    on the top of a bright-green bonnet; and, more wonderful than
    all, the smile of the prettiest lips, and the glances of the
    clearest eyes he had ever seen in his life. The gown, the
    bonnet, the smiles, and eyes, all belonged to Jane Holford; and
    Reginald, who had, up to this time, made no great progress in
    the study of comparative physiology, now made such rapid
    strides, that he could have told you every point in which the
    possessor of the above-named attributes differed from the stiff
    and prim Miss de Mawley, who had hitherto been the sole
    representative of the female sex in Mawley Court. The neck and
    shoulders&mdash;the chin&mdash;nose&mdash;arms&mdash;
    ankles&mdash;feet&mdash;not to mention the hair and
    eyebrows&mdash;of the new specimen, were minutely studied; and,
    in spite of the usual antipathy he entertained against all
    scientific pursuits, he felt a strong inclination to be the
    owner of it himself, in order to pursue his investigations at
    full leisure. He was no genius&mdash;hated books&mdash;disliked
    clever people&mdash;but prided himself on his horsemanship, his
    play at quarterstaff, his personal strength, and, above all, in
    his fine old castle in a somewhat inaccessible part of
    Yorkshire, which had remained in the possession of his family
    ever since the Conquest. Jane, on the other hand, had no castle
    to boast of; and probably had no ancestor whatever at any
    period preceding the year 1750, when her grandfather had bought
    an estate near Mawley Court&mdash;which had gone on improving
    with the improvement of the times, till her father found
    himself the possessor of a rent-roll of fifteen hundred a year,
    four sons, and six grown-up daughters. It will easily be
    believed that no objections to the match were raised on the
    part of a middle-aged gentleman, with so many reasons for
    agreeing to the marriage settlement proposed by Reginald
    Belfront; consisting, as it did, of a jointure to the widow,
    and the use of Belfront Castle for life, without the remotest
    allusion to any portion or other contingent advantage on the
    other side; and as Jane herself was, if possible, still more
    satisfied on the subject than her father, all the arrangements
    were rapidly made, and in less than three months after the
    apparition of the silk gown and other etceteras in the
    drawing-room, the indissoluble knot was tied, and Miss Cecilia,
    the second daughter, was advanced to the dignity of Miss
    Holford, vice Jane&mdash;promoted.</p>

    <p>The church was all decked out with roses and other pleasing
    emblems of the unfading nature of connubial bliss; wreaths of
    sunflowers, with the same comfortable moral, were hung up over
    the great gate of Mawley Court; while Miss de Mawley,
    representing in her own person the evergreens omitted in the
    garlands, received the happy couple on their return from the
    ceremony at the head of all the female domestics, from the
    housekeeper down to the kitchenmaid, and led the bride and
    bridegroom to the table in the great hall, where old Sir Hugh
    was sitting in great state. They kneeled down before his chair;
    and, laying his hand on their heads, he began blessing;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page335"
       name="page335"></a>[pg 335]</span> but not having practised
       that style of oratory so much as he ought, it rapidly
       degenerated into a grace&mdash;and, as lunch in the mean
       time was brought in, and the Holford family, and one or two
       of the neighbours who had been present at the ceremony, had
       now arrived, the eloquence of Sir Hugh was not altogether
       thrown away. There were several speeches and toasts, and
       sundry attempts at jocularity; and Sir Hugh began the story
       of the French countess and the waterfall at Fountainbleau;
       and Reginald availed himself of the somnolency of the rest
       of the party to slip out with his bride without being
       observed, just as the royal family began to suspect the
       secret&mdash;and, long before the incensed husband sent the
       challenge, the happy pair were careering onward as fast as
       the postboy could drive, on the first stage of their wedding
       tour.</p>

    <p>A month afterwards they were in a country inn in Wales. The
    window at which they sat commanded a view of the beautiful vale
    of Cwmcwyllchly&mdash;a small river glided down in winding
    mazes, hiding itself behind wooded knolls, and brawling over
    rocks in the most playful and picturesque manner imaginable.
    The sun had begun to set, and was taking a last look at the
    prospect, with his vast chin rested on the top of Penchymcrwm,
    presenting to the poetical mind an image of a redfaced farmer
    looking over a five-barred gate&mdash;every thing, in short,
    that is generally met with in Tourists' Guides, as constituting
    a splendid view, was assembled on this favoured spot; and yet
    Jane heaved a deep sigh, and appeared to take no notice of the
    landscape.</p>

    <p>"You're tired, my love," said Reginald; "you have walked too
    far up these Welsh mountains."</p>

    <p>"I hope to get used to climbing," answered Jane; "there are
    plenty of hills at Belfront&mdash;aren't there?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, we have plenty of hills; but why don't you call it
    home, Jane?"</p>

    <p>"Because I have never lived there," she replied; "and a
    place can scarcely be called home that one has never seen."</p>

    <p>"But you have never said you wished to see it."</p>

    <p>"Oh, but I have wished it all the same&mdash;may
    we&mdash;may we go&mdash;home?"</p>

    <p>She said the word at last, and Reginald was delighted.</p>

    <p>"Home! to be sure&mdash;to-morrow, at daybreak; for, to tell
    you the truth, I don't care sixpence for fine views&mdash;in
    fact, I don't think there is any difference between any two
    landscapes&mdash;except that there may be hills in one, and
    none in another, or woods, or a river&mdash;but they are all
    exactly the same in reality. So, let us go home, my love, as
    fast as we can, or I'm very much afraid Mr Peeper won't like
    it."</p>

    <p>"Mr Peeper?" enquired Jane. "Who is Mr Peeper?"</p>

    <p>"You will know him in good time," said Reginald; "and I hope
    he will like you."</p>

    <p>"I hope he will&mdash;I hope all your friends will like
    me&mdash;I will do every thing in my power to please them."</p>

    <p>"You're a very good girl, Jane; and Mr Peeper can't help but
    be pleased, and I am glad of it; for it ought to be our first
    study to make ourselves agreeable to <i>him</i>."</p>

    <p>"Agreeable to Mr Peeper!" thought Jane. "How strange that I
    never was told about him before this moment! Does he live in
    the castle, Reginald?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"Certainly. One of his family has lived there ever since one
    of mine did; so there is a connexion between us of a few
    hundred years."</p>

    <p>"Have you any other friends who live in the castle?"
    enquired the bride.</p>

    <p>"I don't know whether Phil Lorimer is there just now or not;
    he has a room whenever he comes; and a knife and fork at
    table."</p>

    <p>"Who is he?"</p>

    <p>"A capital fellow&mdash;full of wit&mdash;and makes funnier
    faces and better songs than any man in Yorkshire. You will like
    Phil Lorimer."</p>

    <p>"And I hope he will like me!"</p>

    <p>"If he don't, I'll break every bone in his body."</p>

    <p>"Oh! I beg you won't," said the bride with a smile, and
    looking up in Reginald's face to assure herself he spoke in
    joke. It was as earnest a face as if it had been of cast-iron;
    and she saw that Mr Lorimer's only chance of preserving a whole
    skin was to like her with all his might.</p>

    <p>"Is there any one else?"</p>

    <p>"There's Mr Peeper's assistant, <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page336"
       name="page336"></a>[pg 336]</span> Mark Lutter&mdash;a
       clever man, and a great scholar. I hate scholars, so he
       dines in the servants' hall, or far down the
       table&mdash;below the salt."</p>

    <p>"Are you serious?" enquired Jane.</p>

    <p>"Do you not like scholars?"</p>

    <p>"What's the use of them? I never could see what they were
    good for&mdash;and, besides, Mr Peeper hates them too."</p>

    <p>"Then why does he keep this man as his assistant?"</p>

    <p>"Because if he didn't, the fellow would rebel."</p>

    <p>"Well, you could turn him off."</p>

    <p>"We never turn any body off at Belfront Castle. If they go
    of their own accord, we punish them for it if we can&mdash;if
    they stay, they are welcome. Mr Peeper must look to it, or
    Lutter will make a disturbance."</p>

    <p>"What a curious place this castle must be," thought Jane,
    "and what odd people they are that live in it!" She asked no
    more questions, but determined to restrain her curiosity till
    she could satisfy it on the spot; and, luckily, she had not
    long to wait. Next day they started on their homeward way. As
    they drew nearer their destination, Jane's anxiety to gain the
    first glimpse of her future home increased with every mile. She
    had, of course, formed many fancy pictures of it in her own
    mind; and, as love lent the brush and most obligingly
    compounded the colours, there can be no doubt they made out a
    very captivating landscape of it between them.</p>

    <p>"At the top of the next hill," said Reginald, "you will see
    the keep."</p>

    <p>Jane stretched her head forward, and looked through the
    front window as if she could pierce the hill that lay between
    her and home. On went the horses; but the next hill seemed an
    incredible way off; it was now getting late, and the shadows of
    evening, like a flock of tired black sheep, began to lie down
    and rest thenselves on the vast dreary moor they were
    travelling over. At last Jane felt that they were beginning an
    ascent; and a sickly moon, that seemed to have undergone a
    severe operation, and lost nearly all her limbs, lifted up her
    pale face in the sky. The wind, too, began to whistle in long
    low gusts, and Reginald, who was not of a poetical temperament,
    as we have already observed, was nearly asleep. They reached
    the hill top at last, and a great expanse of rugged and broken
    country lay before them.</p>

    <p>"Where is it?&mdash;on which hand?" said Jane.</p>

    <p>"Straight before you," replied the husband; "it is only
    three miles off; the high-road turns off to the left, but we go
    through fields right on."</p>

    <p>Jane looked with almost feverish anxiety. At a good distance
    in front, rose a tall black structure, like the chimney of a
    shot manufactory&mdash;a single, square, gigantic
    tower&mdash;throwing a darker mass against the darkened sky,
    and sicklied o'er on one of the faces with the yellow-green
    moonlight. There were no lights in it, nor any sign of
    habitation; and Jane would have indulged in various enquiries
    and exclamations, if the carriage had allowed her; but it had
    by this time left the main road, and sank up to the axles in
    the ruts; it bounded against stones, and wallowed in mire
    alternately; and all that she could do, was to hold on by one
    of the arm rests, as if she had been in the cabin of a
    storm-toss'd ship.</p>

    <p>"For mercy's sake, Reginald, will this last long?" she said,
    out of breath with her exertions.</p>

    <p>"We are about a mile from the drawbridge. I hope they have
    not drawn it up."</p>

    <p>"Could we not get into the castle if they have?"</p>

    <p>"We might fall into the moat if we tried the postern."</p>

    <p>"Oh, gracious!&mdash;is there a moat?"&mdash;and
    instinctively she put her hand to her throat, for her mother
    had brought her up with a salutary dread of colds, and she felt
    a sensation of choking at the very name.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the agonized carriage, after several groans
    that would have moved the heart of a highway commissioner, gave
    a rush downward, and committed suicide in the most determined
    manner, by dashing its axle on the ground&mdash;the wheels
    endeavouring in vain to fathom the profundity of the ruts, and
    the horses totally unable to move the stranded equipage. The
    sudden jerk knocked Reginald's hat over his eyes against the
    roof of the carriage, and Jane screamed when she felt the top
    of her bonnet squeezed as flat as a pancake by the same
    process, but neither of them, luckily, was hurt.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page337"
       name="page337"></a>[pg 337]</span> "We must get out and
       walk," said the husband; "it isn't more than half a mile,
       and we will send Phil Lorimer, or some of them, for the
       trunks."</p>

    <p>He put his arm round Jane's waist, and helped her over the
    almost impassable track.</p>

    <p>"We must try to get the road mended," said Jane.</p>

    <p>"It has never been mended in our time," was the reply; and
    it was said in a tone which showed that the fact so announced
    was an unanswerable argument against the proposition of the
    bride.</p>

    <p>"A few stones well broken would do it all," she urged.</p>

    <p>"We never break stones at Belfront," was the rejoinder; and
    in silence, and with some difficulty, they groped their
    unsteady way. At last they emerged from a thick overgrown
    copse, in which the accident had happened, and, after sundry
    narrow escapes from sprained ankles and broken arms, they
    reached the gate. It was an immense wooden barrier, supported
    at each end by little round buildings&mdash;like a slice of
    toast laid lengthways between two half pounds of butter. It was
    thickly studded with iron nails, and the round piers were of
    massive stone, partly overgrown with ivy, and as solid as if
    they had been formed of one mass.</p>

    <p>"Does any body live in those lodges?" enquired Jane.</p>

    <p>"There is a warder in the inner court," said Reginald.
    "These are merely the supporters of the outer gate."</p>

    <p>"And how are we to get in?"</p>

    <p>"We must blow, I suppose." And so saying, Reginald lifted up
    a horn that was hung by an iron chain from one of the piers,
    and executed a flourish that made Jane put her fingers to her
    ears.</p>

    <p>In a short time the creaking of an iron chain&mdash;whose
    recollection of oil must have been of the most traditionary
    nature&mdash;gave intimation that its intentions were decidedly
    hospitable; and with many squeaks and grunts the enormous
    portal turned at last on its hinges, and exposed to view a
    narrow winding road between two walls, which, in a short time,
    conducted the visitors to a long wooden bridge over a piece of
    stagnant water&mdash;the said bridge having only that moment
    been let down from the lofty position in which its two halves
    were kept by an immense wooden erection, which bore an awful
    resemblance to a scaffold. When they got over the bridge,
    Reginald turned round, and, imprinting a kiss on the pale cheek
    of the astonished bride, said&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Welcome home, dear Jane. This is Belfront Castle!"</p>

    <p>Jane looked round a spacious courtyard, and saw a square of
    low dark-looking buildings, with the enormous tower she had
    seen from the top of the hill rearing its thick head above all
    at one corner. They proceeded across the roughly-paved
    quadrangle, and entered a low door; ascended three steps, and
    opened another door. They then found themselves in a large and
    lofty hall, with fitful flashes of red light flickering on the
    walls, as the flame of the wood fire on the hearth rose or fell
    beneath the efforts of a half distinguishable figure, extended
    at full length on the floor, and puffing the enormous log with
    a pair of gigantic bellows. In the palpable obscure, Jane could
    scarcely make out the persons of the occupants of the
    apartment; but when the flame burnt up a little more powerfully
    than usual, she observed the figure of a tall man dressed in
    black, who shook hands with Reginald, and bowed very coldly and
    formally to her, when he was introduced as Mr Peeper. He seemed
    about fifty or sixty years of age, but very much enfeebled. He
    stooped and coughed, and was very infirm in his motions; but
    when the red glare from the hearth fell upon his eyes, they
    fixed themselves on Jane with such a piercing expression, that
    she turned away her face almost in fear. His hair was
    snow-white, and yet it was impossible to decide whether he was
    a man of the years we have stated, with the premature
    appearance of age, or a person of extraordinary longevity,
    retaining the vigorous eyes and active spirit of youth. However
    it was, Mr Peeper was too harsh and haughty in his approaches,
    and exacted too much deference from the youthful bride, to be
    very captivating at first. He said no welcome to the new-comer,
    and was stiff and unkind even to the owner of the castle.
    Candles were soon brought in, and Jane took the opportunity of
    looking round. The individual <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page338"
       name="page338"></a>[pg 338]</span> who had been busy blowing
       the fire now rose from his humble position, and was
       presented to the lady as Phil Lorimer. He bowed and smiled,
       and was proceeding with a compliment, in which, however, he
       advanced no further than the summer sun bringing out the
       roses, when Reginald pushed him out of the hall, with orders
       to get the luggage brought in from the carriage, and to be
       back in time for supper. Phil Lorimer seemed a man of
       thirty, strongly built, with a sweet voice and friendly
       smile; but what station he filled in the
       household&mdash;whether a servant, a visitor, a poor
       relation, or what he could be, Jane could not make out,
       either from his manner or the way he was treated.</p>

    <p>"Mr Lorimer is very good-natured&mdash;very obliging, to
    take care of the luggage, I am sure," said Jane.</p>

    <p>"Better that than talking nonsense about roses," replied
    Reginald. "Did you expect us this evening, Mr Peeper?"</p>

    <p>"I did, Mr Reginald, and have invited a few of the
    neighbours to meet you."</p>

    <p>"Who are coming?"</p>

    <p>"Sir Bryan De Barreilles, Hasket of Norland, Maulerer of
    Phascald, and old Dr Howlet. They will be here soon, so you had
    better make haste."</p>

    <p>"I had better not appear, love," said Jane; "no ladies are
    coming, and among so many gentlemen my presence might be
    awkward."</p>

    <p>"By no means," replied the husband. "It wouldn't be right,
    Mr Peeper, for my wife to be absent from the supper-table?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly not. It is to see <i>her</i> the neighbours are
    coming."</p>

    <p>Is this Mr Peeper to have the control of all my actions?
    thought Jane. Who can he be?</p>

    <p>She took another glance at the object of her thoughts, but
    caught his eye fixed on her with the same penetrating
    brightness as before; and she cast her looks on the ground;
    and, whether from anger or fear, she felt her cheeks glowing
    with blushes.</p>

    <p>"You will not be long gone, if you please," he said to Jane
    as she retired to change her dress.</p>

    <p>"You don't seem pleased to see us, Mr Peeper," said
    Reginald, when Jane had gone to her room under the guidance of
    a very tall old woman, who walked before her, holding out a
    tremendously long candle, as if it were a sword, and she was at
    the head of a military procession.</p>

    <p>"No, sir," replied Mr Peeper; "I am not pleased with the
    person you have brought here. You have gone too far from home
    for a wife. None of the Belfronts have ever married out of
    Yorkshire, and it may give rise to troubles."</p>

    <p>"I am very sorry my wife's relations would not allow me to
    send for you to perform the ceremony."</p>

    <p>"It is a bad omen," said the old man; "my predecessors have
    married your predecessors without a break since the conquest.
    It bodes no good."</p>

    <p>"I trust no harm will happen, and that you will soon forget
    the disappointment."</p>

    <p>"None of my family forget, but we will not <i>talk</i> of
    it." So saying, he turned away, and arranged a goodly array of
    bottles on the sideboard. Reginald sat down on an oak chair
    beside the fire, and gazed attentively into the log.</p>

    <p>In the mean time, Jane had followed her gigantic conductor
    through half a mile of passages, and reached a small room at
    one end of the quadrangle, and through the window (of which
    half the panes were broken, as if on purpose) she caught the
    melodious murmur of a rapid river, that chafed against the
    foundation walls of the castle. On looking round, the prospect
    was not very encouraging. Tattered tapestries hung down the
    walls, and waved in a most melancholy and ghost-like fashion in
    the wind; the floor was thinly littered over with some plaited
    rushes, to supply the place of a carpet; and a few long
    high-backed oak chairs kept guard against the wall. The fire
    had died an infant in its iron cradle, the grate; and the
    curtain of the bed waved to and fro in mournful sympathy with
    the tapestry round the room. Jane was so cold that she could
    hardly go through her toilette, simple as it was; but having at
    last achieved a very slight alteration in her dress, and left
    her bonnet on the head of an owl, which formed the ornament of
    one of the high-backed chairs, she endeavoured to retrace her
    steps; and after a few pauses and mistakes, she found her way
    once more into the hall.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page339"
       name="page339"></a>[pg 339]</span> The guests in the mean
       time were assembled and had seated themselves at table. On
       Jane's entrance they all rose, and on being respectively
       named by their host, bowed with cold and stately courtesy,
       and sat down again. The four strangers seemed all of the
       same ages, fifty or thereabouts&mdash;tall, hale, and
       dignified in their manners. Sir Bryan de Barreilles had a
       patch on his right eye; Hasket of Norland a deep scar on his
       forehead, that cut his left eyebrow into two parts, and gave
       a very extraordinary expression to his rigid countenance;
       Maulerer of Phascald had the general effect of very handsome
       features, marred by the want of his nose; not that there was
       actually no nose, but that it did not occupy the prominent
       position it usually holds on the human face divine, but was
       inserted deep between the cheeks&mdash;in fact, was a nose
       not set on after the fashion of a knocker, but a fine
       specimen of <i>basso-relievo</i>, indented after the manner
       of Socrates's head on a seal, and would probably have made a
       very fine impression. Dr Howlet was perfectly blind, and
       from the tone in which he was addressed by the other
       gentlemen, Jane concluded he was also very nearly deaf.
       Besides these, there were present Mr Peeper, at the foot of
       the table next to Reginald, and on the other side of him a
       thick square-built man, with a fine hilarious open
       countenance, who was perhaps of too low a rank to be
       introduced to the lady of the castle&mdash;no other in fact
       than the redoubtable Mr Lutter, of whom Jane had heard on
       her journey home.</p>

    <p>After the serving men, with some difficulty, had brought in
    the supper, consisting of enormous joints of meat, hot and
    cold, and deposited on the sideboard vast tankards of strong
    ale and other potent beverages, Mr Peeper rose, and folding his
    hands across his breast, and bending forward his head with
    every appearance of devotion, muttered some words evidently
    intended to represent a grace; but so indistinct that it was
    utterly impossible to make the slightest guess at their
    meaning, whereupon they all fell to with prodigious activity,
    and cut and slashed the enormous dishes as if they had been
    famished for a year. Mr Lutter, after making an observation
    that true thankfulness was as much shown by moderate enjoyment
    of good gifts as by long prayers said over them, made a most
    powerful assault on the cold sirloin, and, of all the party,
    was the only one who had the politeness to send a helping to
    Jane. She was tired and hungry, and felt really obliged by the
    attention, but could scarcely do justice to the viands from
    surprise at the conversation of the guests.</p>

    <p>"Ho, ho!" said Sir Bryan de Barreilles, "I once knew a
    thing&mdash;such a thing it was too&mdash;ho! ho!" And partly
    the vividness of the recollection, and principally an enormous
    mouthful of beef, produced a long fit of coughing&mdash;"'twill
    make you laugh," he continued&mdash;"'twas a rare
    feat&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;even this lady will be pleased to hear
    it."</p>

    <p>Jane bowed in expectation of an amusing anecdote.</p>

    <p>"One of my tenants was going to be married; his bride was a
    very young creature, not more than eighteen, and on the
    wedding-day, as I always was ready for a joke in those
    days&mdash;ah! 'tis thirty years ago, or more&mdash;I asked the
    bridal party to the Tower. Ho! ho! such laughing we
    had!&mdash;Giles Mallet and Robin Henslow fought with redhot
    brands out of the fire, till I thought we should all have died;
    and Giles&mdash;the cleverest fellow and the wittiest, ho!
    ho!&mdash;such a fellow was Giles!&mdash;he took up the poker
    instead of the fir-log, and watched his opportunity, ho!
    ho!&mdash;it was redhot too&mdash;a good stout poker as ever
    you saw&mdash;and ran it clean through his cheek&mdash;you
    heard the tongue fizz! as it licked the hot iron&mdash;'twas a
    famous play. How Robin roared, to be sure, and couldn't speak
    plain&mdash;ho! ho! Well, the games went on; and nothing would
    please some of the young ones but we should see the Oubliette.
    'Twas a dark hole where my forefathers imprisoned their
    refractory vassals, and sad stories were told about
    it&mdash;how that voices were heard from the bottom of it, and
    groans, and sometimes gory heads were seen at the top of it,
    looking up to the skylight, and struggling to escape, but ever
    tumbling back into the deep dark hole, with screams and
    smothered cries; a rare place for a man's enemies&mdash;but it
    had not been used for many years. Well&mdash;nothing would do,
    but when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page340"
       name="page340"></a>[pg 340]</span> we were all merry with
       ale, we should all go and see the Oubliette, and a kiss of
       the bride was promised to the one who should go down the
       furthest. Now, the stone steps were very narrow at best; and
       were all worn away&mdash;and that was the best of
       it&mdash;all along the passages we went, and past the
       dungeon grating, till we came to the open mouth of the
       Oubliette. Ho! ho! how you'll laugh. Down a step went
       one&mdash;no kiss from the bride for him&mdash;two steps
       went another&mdash;some went down six steps, and one bold
       fellow went down so far that we lost sight of him in the
       darkness. Then the bridegroom, a stout young
       yeoman&mdash;thought it shame to let anyone beat him in
       daring, for so rich a prize as a kiss from the rosy lips of
       his bride, and down&mdash;down&mdash;he went&mdash;step
       after step&mdash;till finally, far down in the gloom, we
       heard a loud scream&mdash;such a scream&mdash;ho! ho! I
       can't help laughing yet when I think of it&mdash;and in a
       minute or two, whose voice should we hear but Giles
       Mallet's! <i>There</i> was Giles, hollowing and roaring for
       us to send down a rope but <i>how</i> he had got down, or
       <i>when</i> he had gone down, nobody knew. However, a rope
       was got, and merrily, stoutly, we all pulled, but no Giles
       came up. Instead of him, we drew forth the bridegroom! but
       such a changed man. His eyes were fixed, and his face as
       white as silver&mdash;his mouth was wide open, and his great
       tongue went lolling about from side to side&mdash;and he
       shook his head, and mumbled and slavered&mdash;he was struck
       all of a sudden into idiocy, and knew nobody; not even his
       bride. She was sinking before him, but he never noticed her,
       but went moaning, and muttering, and shaking his head. Ho!
       ho! 'twas the comicalest thing I ever saw. And when Giles
       came up he explained it all. Giles had gone down deeper than
       any of them, and waited for the others on a ledge in the
       cavern; and just when the bridegroom reached it, Giles
       seized him by the leg, and said&mdash;'Your soul is
       mine'&mdash;ho! ho! 'Your soul is mine,' said
       Giles&mdash;and the bridegroom uttered only the loud, long
       scream we had all heard, and stood and shook and trembled.
       'Twas a rare feat; and if you had come down last
       year"&mdash;he added, turning to Jane&mdash;"you would have
       seen the bridegroom going from door to door, followed by all
       the boys in the village&mdash;he never recovered. There he
       went, shake, shaking his head&mdash;and gape gaping with his
       mouth. "Twas good sport to teaze him. I've set my dogs on
       him myself; but he never took the least notice. 'Twas a good
       trick&mdash;I never knew better."</p>

    <p>"And the bride?" enquired Jane.</p>

    <p>"Oh, she died in a week or two after the adventure! A silly
    hussy&mdash;I wished to marry her, by the left hand, to my
    forester, but she kept on moping and looking at the idiotical
    bridegroom, and died&mdash;a poor fool."</p>

    <p>"Ah! we've grown dull since those merry times," said Hasket
    of Norland, looking, round the empty hall, and then towards
    Reginald, as if reproaching him with the absence of the ancient
    joviality. "There were three men killed at my marriage&mdash;in
    fair give and take fight&mdash;in the hall, at the wedding
    supper. There is the mark of blood on the floor yet."</p>

    <p>"I lost my eye at the celebration of a christening," said
    Sir Bryan de Barreilles. "My uncle of Malmescott pushed it in
    with the handle of his dagger."</p>

    <p>"I got this wound on my forehead at a feast after a
    funeral," said Hasket of Norland. "I quarreled with Morley
    Poyntz, and he cut my eyebrow with an axe. 'Twas a merry party
    in spite of that."</p>

    <p>"The Parson of Pynsent jumped on my face at a festival in
    honour of the birth of Sir Ranulph Berlingcourt's heir," said
    Maulerer of Phascald. "I had been knocked on the floor by the
    Archdeacon of Warleileigh, and the Parson of Pynsent trode on
    my nose. He was the biggest man in Yorkshire, and squeezed my
    nose out of sight&mdash;a rare jovial companion, was the Parson
    of Pynsent, and many is the joke we have had about the weight
    of his foot. Ah! we have no fun now&mdash;no fighting, no
    grinning through a horse-collar, no roasting before a fire, no
    singing"&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Reginald, "we have Phil Lorimer."</p>

    <p>"Let him come&mdash;let us hear him," said some of the
    party.</p>

    <p>"I hate songs," said Dr Howlet; "and think all ballads
    should be burned."</p>

    <p>"And the writers of them, too," added Mr Peeper, with a
    fierce glance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page341"
       name="page341"></a>[pg 341]</span> towards the fireplace,
       from which Phil Lorimer emerged.</p>

    <p>"Oh no! I think songs an innocent diversion," said Mr
    Lutter, "and softening to the heart. Sit near me, Mr
    Lorimer."</p>

    <p>"Make a face, Phil," cried the knight; "I would rather see a
    grin than hear your ballad."</p>

    <p>"Jump, Phil," said Hasket of Norland, applying his fork to
    Phil's leg as he passed, "you are a better morris-dancer than a
    poet."</p>

    <p>Phil, who was imperturbably good-natured, did as he was
    told. He opened his mouth to a preternatural size, turned one
    eye to the ceiling, and the other down to the floor, till Sir
    Bryan was in ecstasies at his achievement. He then sprang to an
    incredible height in that air, and danced once or twice through
    the hall, throwing himself into the most grotesque attitudes
    imaginable, and the table was nearly shaken in pieces by the
    thumpings with which the party showed their satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"Now then, Phil; here's a cup of sherry-wine&mdash;drink it,
    boy, and sing a sweet song to the lady," said Reginald.</p>

    <p>"Songs are an invention of the devil," said Mr Peeper.</p>

    <p>"Unless they are sung through the nose," said Mr Lutter,
    with a sneer.</p>

    <p>"You approve of songs then?" inquired Mr Peeper, with a
    fierce look.</p>

    <p>"Certainly," said Mr Lutter, "when their subject is good,
    and the language modest."</p>

    <p>"Then you are an atheist," retorted Mr Peeper.</p>

    <p>"What has a ballad to do with atheism?" enquired Mr Lutter,
    looking angry.</p>

    <p>"You approve of wicked songs, and therefore are an
    atheist."</p>

    <p>"A man is more like an atheist," retorted Mr Lutter, "who is
    ungrateful to God for the gift of song, and shuts up the
    sweetest avenue by which the spirit approaches its Creator. I
    admire poetry, and respect poets."</p>

    <p>"Any one who holds such diabolic doctrines is not fit to
    remain in Belfront Castle."</p>

    <p>"Nay," replied Mr Lutter, "Belfront Castle would be
    infinitely improved if such doctrines were adopted in it."</p>

    <p>"Gentlemen," said Reginald, "you are both learned men; and I
    know nothing about the questions you discuss."</p>

    <p>"Your lady shall judge between us," said Mr Lutter.</p>

    <p>"She shall not," said Mr Peeper; "I am the sole judge in
    matters of the kind."</p>

    <p>"Let us hear Phil's song in the mean time," said Reginald.
    "Come, Lorimer."</p>

    <p>"What shall it be?" said Phil.</p>

    <p>"Something comic," said Sir Bryan.</p>

    <p>"Something bloody," said Hasket of Norland.</p>

    <p>"Something loving," said Maulerer of Phascald.</p>

    <p>"Will the lady decide for us?" said Phil, with a smile.
    "Will you have the 'Silver Scarf,' madam; or 'the Knight and
    the Soldan of Bagdad?' They are both done into my poor English
    from the troubadours of Almeigne."</p>

    <p>The lady fixed, at haphazard, on "the Knight and the Soldan
    of Bagdad:" and Phil prepared to obey her commands. He took a
    small harp in his hand, and sate down in the vacant chair next
    to Sir Bryan de Bareilles. The rest of the company composed
    themselves to listen; and, after a short prelude, Lorimer, in a
    fine manly voice, began&mdash;</p>

            <p class="i2">Such a sweet stream of sound,</p>

            <p>That the Soldan's heart leaps up in his breast,</p>

            <p class="i2">And his eye he casts around.</p>

            <p>'Oh, tell me, thou minstrel dear,' he said,</p>

            <p>And kiss'd her brow, and told the tale</p>

            <p class="i2">Of his dungeon, deep and strong;</p>

            <p>And of the minstrel, too, he told</p>

            <p>And told, with many a bitter sneer,</p>

            <p class="i2">How that, for many a day,</p>

            <p>When he was prison'd in Paynim land,</p>

            <p>His hand close clutch'd on his dagger heft,</p>

            <p class="i2">And down the hall he stept;</p>

            <p>And onwards with the dagger bared,</p>

            <p class="i2">He rush'd to the lady's bower&mdash;</p>

            <p>'Thou hast been false, and left thy home&mdash;</p>

            <p>One prayer I would say for thee and me&mdash;</p>

            <p class="i2">One prayer&mdash;before I die!'</p>

            <p>She left the bower; and as he stept</p>

            <p class="i2">To and fro in ireful mood,</p>

            <p>A stranger from the chamber came,</p>

            <p class="i2">And close behind him stood.</p>

            <p>Long locks of molten yellow gold</p>

            <p class="i2">Hung over his cheek so brown,</p>

            <p>And a red mantle of Venice silk,</p>

            <p class="i2">Fell from his shoulder, down.</p>

            <p>Dark frown'd the knight&mdash;'Vile churl!' he
            said;</p>

            <p class="i2">But ere he utter'd more,</p>

            <p>The stranger let the mantle fall</p>

            <p class="i2">Unclasp'd upon the floor,&mdash;</p>

            <p>And off he cast the yellow locks&mdash;</p>

            <p class="i2">And, lo! the lady fair,</p>

            <p>Blushing and casting from her cheek</p>

            <p class="i2">Her glossy raven hair!</p>

            <p>Down fell the dagger; down the knight</p>

            <p class="i2">Sank kneeling and opprest;</p>

            <p>And the lady oped her snow white arms,</p>

            <p class="i2">And wept upon his breast!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"A foul song!&mdash;a wanton woman!"&mdash;exclaimed Sir
    Bryan de Barreilles&mdash;"he should have stabbed her for
    living so long with a Jew villain like the Soldan of
    Bagdad."</p>

    <p>"Was the villain a Jew?" enquired Dr Howlet, who had caught
    the word. "I did not know Bagdad was in Jewry. Is a heathen the
    same as a Jew, Mr Peeper?"</p>

    <p>The gentleman thus appealed to, coughed as if to clear his
    throat, and though he usually spoke with the utmost clearness,
    he mumbled and muttered in the same unintelligible manner as he
    had done when he was saying grace; and it was a very peculiar
    habit of the learned individual, whenever he was applied to for
    an explanation, to betake himself to a mode of
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page343"
       name="page343"></a>[pg 343]</span> speech that would have
       puzzled a far wiser head than Dr Howlet's, to make head or
       tail of it.</p>

    <p>Dr Howlett, however, appeared to be perfectly satisfied with
    the information; and by the indignant manner in which he struck
    his long gold-headed ebony walking-stick on the floor, seemed
    entirely to agree with the worthy knight in his estimate of the
    heroine of Phil Lorimer's ballad.</p>

    <p>"I like the ballad about the jousting of Romulus the bold
    Roman, with Judas Maccabaeus in the Camp at Ascalon far
    better," said Hasket of Norland. "Sing it, Phil."</p>

    <p>"No, no," cried Maulerer, who was far gone in intoxication.
    "Sing us the song of the Feasting at Glaston, when Eneas the
    Trojan married Arthur's daughter.&mdash;Sing the song, sirrah,
    this moment, or I'll cut your tongue in two, to make your note
    the sweeter.&mdash;Sing."</p>

    <p>Thus adjured, Phil once more began:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"There was feasting high and revelry</p>

            <p class="i2">In Glaston's lofty hall;</p>

            <p>And loud was the sound, as the cup went round,</p>

            <p class="i2">Of joyous whoop and call;</p>

            <p>And Arthur the king, in that noble ring,</p>

            <p class="i2">Was the merriest of them all.</p>

            <p>No thought, no care, found entrance there,</p>

            <p class="i2">But beauty's smiles were won;</p>

            <p>No sour Jack Priest to spoil the feast"&mdash;</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Ha!" cried Howlet, interrupting Mr Lorimer in a tremendous
    passion, "what says the varlet? He is a heathen Turk, and no
    Christian. How dares he talk so of the church?" The old man
    rose as he spoke, and, suddenly catching hold of the enormous
    ebony walking-stick, which generally reposed at the side of his
    chair, he aimed a blow with all his force at the unfortunate
    songster; but, being blind, and not calculating his distance,
    his staff fell with tremendous effect on the left eye of Sir
    Bryan de Barreilles.</p>

    <p>"Is it so?" cried the Knight, stunned; but resisting the
    tendency to prostration produced by the stroke, and flinging a
    large silver flagon across the table, which missed Dr Howlet,
    and made a deep indentation in the skull of Maulerer of
    Phascald&mdash;"Now, then!"</p>

    <p>Hasket of Norland attempted to hold Sir Bryan, and prevent
    his following up his attack; and Mr Maulerer recovered
    sufficiently to fling the heavy candlestick at his assailant;
    the branches of which hit the cheek of Hasket, while the
    massive bottom ejected the three front teeth of Sir Bryan.</p>

    <p>There was now no possibility of preventing the quarrel; and
    while the four strangers were pounding each other with whatever
    weapons came first to hand, and Mr Peeper crept under the table
    for safety, and Reginald essayed to talk them into reason, Mr
    Lutter politely handed Jane to the door of the hall.</p>

    <p>"Permit me, madam, to rescue you from this dreadful
    scene."</p>

    <p>"Is it thus always?" enquired Jane, nearly weeping with
    fright.</p>

    <p>"There are many things that may be improved in the castle,"
    said Mr Lutter. "I have seen the necessity of an alteration for
    a long time, and, if you will favour me with your assistance,
    much may be done."</p>

    <p>"Oh! I will help you to the utmost of my power."</p>

    <p>"We must upset the influence of Mr Peeper," said Mr Lutter.
    "May I speak to you on the subject to-morrow?"</p>

    <p>A month had passed since Jane's arrival at Belfront Castle,
    and she had had many private and confidential conversations
    with Mr Lutter. The ominous eyes of Mr Peeper grew fiercer and
    fiercer, and she many times thought of coming to an open
    rupture with him at once; but was deterred from doing so, by
    not yet having ascertained whether her influence over Reginald
    was sufficiently established to stand a contest with the
    authority of his ancient friend. She could not understand how
    her husband could have remained hoodwinked so long; or how he
    had submitted to the despotic proceedings of his former tutor,
    who persisted in assembling the same airs of authority over
    him, as he had exercised when he was a child. Such, however,
    was evidently the case; and Reginald had never entertained a
    thought of rescuing himself from the thraldom in which he had
    grown up. A look from Mr Peeper; a solemn statement from him,
    that such and such things had never been heard of before in
    Belfront; and, above all, the use of the muttered and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page344"
       name="page344"></a>[pg 344]</span> unintelligible jargon to
       which Mr Peeper betook himself in matters of weight and
       difficulty, were quite sufficient: Reginald immediately gave
       up his own judgment, and felt in fact rather ashamed of
       himself for having hinted that he had a judgement at all.
       Under these circumstances, Mr Lutter had a very difficult
       part to play; and all that Jane could do, was to second him
       whenever she had the opportunity. One day, in the lovely
       month of April, Phil Lorimer sat on a sunny part of the
       enornous wall that guarded the castle, and leaning his back
       against one of the little square towers that rose at
       intervals in the circuit of the fortifications, sang song
       after song, as if for the edification of a number of crows
       that were perched on the trees on the other side of the
       moat. The audience were grossly inattentive, and paid no
       respect whatever to the performer, who still continued his
       exertions, as highly satisfied as if he were applauded by
       boxes, pit, and gallery of a crowded theatre:&mdash;Among
       others, he sang the ballad of the "Silver Scarf."</p>

    <p>"Here, you cursed old piper! leave off frightening the
    crows, and open the gate this moment. Who the devil, do you
    think, is to burst a bloodvessel by hollowing here all
    day?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lorimer, though used to considerable indignities, as we
    have already seen, had still a little of the becoming poetical
    pride about him, and looked rather angrily over the wall.
    "Nobody wishes you to break bloodvessels, or have their own
    ears disturbed by your screaming," he said. "What do you
    want?"</p>

    <p>"To get into your infernal house, to be sure. Where did you
    get such unchristian roads? My bones are sore with the jolting.
    Send somebody to open the gate."</p>

    <p>"The drawbridge is up, and Mr Peeper must have his
    twopence."</p>

    <p>"Who the devil is Mr Peeper?" said the stranger. "I sha'n't
    give him a fraction. Who made the drawbridge his? Is Mr
    Belfront at home?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, he is in Mr Peeper's study."</p>

    <p>"And Mrs Belfront?"&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Pickling cod. It is Mr Peeper's favourite dish; so we all
    live on it sometimes for weeks together."</p>

    <p>"With such a trout-stream at your door? He'll be a cleverer
    fellow than I think him if he gets me to eat <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page345"
       name="page345"></a>[pg 345]</span> his salted carrion. Open
       the door, I say, or you'll have the worst of it when my
       stick gets near your head. Tell Mrs Belfront her uncle is
       here&mdash;her Uncle Samson."</p>

    <p>Phil Lorimer saw no great resemblance to the Jewish Hercules
    in the little, dapper, bustling-mannered man in a blue coat
    with bright brass buttons, pepper-and-salt knee-breeches, and
    long gaiters, who thus proclaimed his relationship to the lady
    of the castle. He hurried down from the wall to make the
    required announcement.</p>

    <p>"My uncle Samson, the manufacturer, from Leeds! Oh, let him
    in, by all means!" exclaimed Jane; "he was always so kind to me
    when I was a child!"</p>

    <p>"He can't get in, madam, unless Mr Peeper orders the
    drawbridge to be lowered; and he is now busy with Mr
    Belfront."</p>

    <p>"Go for Mr Lutter; he will be glad to hear of uncle Samson's
    arrival."</p>

    <p>Mr Lorimer discovered Mr Lutter comfortably regaling himself
    in the buttery; but on hearing in what respect his services
    were required, he left unfinished a large tankard of ale, with
    which he was washing down an enormous quantity of bread and
    cheese, and proceeded to the moat.</p>

    <p>"Don't disturb Mr Peeper," he said, "but help me to launch
    the little punt."</p>

    <p>By dint of a little labour, the small vessel was got into
    the water, and Mr Lutter, taking a scull in his hand, paddled
    over to the other side, and embarked the gentleman in the blue
    coat. Paddling towards an undefended part of the castle, he
    taught him how to clamber up the wall; and Mr Samson, wiping
    the stains of his climbing from the knees of his nether
    habiliments, looked round the castle-yard. "Well! who'd have
    thought that such a monstrous strong-looking place should be
    stormed by a middle-aged gentleman in a punt!"</p>

    <p>"You've a friend in the garrison, you'll remember, sir, and
    the battlements have never been repaired."</p>

    <p>"They ain't worth repairing. It's a regular waste of
    building materials to make such thick walls and pinnacles.
    Blowed, if them stones wouldn't build a mill; and a precious
    water-power, too," he added, as he saw the river sparkling
    downward at the northern side. "Oho! I must have a talk with
    Jane. Will you take me to Mrs Belfront? I haven't seen her for
    five years. She must be much changed since then, and I must
    prepare her for the arrival of her cousins."</p>

    <p>Jane was sitting in the great hall, feeling disconsolate
    enough. Often, in her father's comfortable parlour, she had
    read accounts of baronial residences of the olden time; and one
    of the greatest pleasures she had felt in becoming Mrs
    Belfront, was to be the possessor of a real <i>bona fide</i>
    castle that had been actually a fortress in the days of
    knighthood. She had studied long ago the adventures of
    high-born dames and stately nobles, till she was nearly as far
    gone in romance as Don Quixote; and many questions she had
    asked about Belfront, and donjon-towers, and keeps, and
    tiltyards, and laboured very hard to acquire a correct idea of
    the mode of life and manners of the days of chivalry. Her
    imagination, we have seen, was too lively to be restrained by
    the more matter-of-fact nature of her husband; and she now felt
    with great bitterness the difference between presiding at a
    tournament, or being present at the Vow of the Peacock, and the
    slavish submission in which she, with the whole household, was
    held by Mr Pepper. Deeply she now regretted the feelings of
    superiority she had experienced over her own relations by her
    marriage into such an ancient race as the Belfronts. She felt
    ashamed of the contempt she had felt for the industrious
    founders of her own family's wealth, and at that moment would
    have preferred the blue coat and brass buttons of her uncle
    Samson, to all the escutcheons and shields of the Norman
    conquest; and at that moment, luckily, the identical coat and
    buttons made their appearance.</p>

    <p>"Well, niece, here's a go!" exclaimed the angry uncle. "Is
    this a way to receive a near relation after such a
    journey?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, uncle!"</p>

    <p>"Why, did ye never hear tell of such a place as
    Kidderminster?&mdash;have you no carpets?"</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page346"
       name="page346"></a>[pg 346]</span> "Mr Belfront says there
       were no carpets in his ancestor's time"&mdash;</p>

    <p>"And no railroads, nor postchaises, nor books, nor nothing;
    and is that any reason why we shouldn't have lots of every
    thing now? By dad, before I've been here a week I'll have a
    reg'lar French Revolution! No Bastille! says I; let's have a
    Turkey carpet, and a telescope dining-table, good roads, and no
    infernal punts&mdash;and, above all, let's get quit of the
    villain Peeper."</p>

    <p>"Oh! if Reginald would only consent!"</p>

    <p>"Why not? by dad, I'll make his fortune. I'll give him a
    thousand a-year for the water-power that's now all thrown away.
    I'll have a nice village built down in the valley. I'll get him
    two guineas an acre for his land that's now lying waste. I'll
    dig for coal. We'll build a nice comfortable house, and leave
    this old ruin to the crows."</p>

    <p>"And the neighbours, uncle Samson?"</p>

    <p>"Why, we'll build a church, and the parson will be a good
    companion. When the roads are made, you'll give a jolly dinner
    once a-week to every squire within ten miles. You'll have a
    book club. You'll help in the Sunday school. You'll go to the
    county balls. Your husband will join the agricultural society,
    and act as a magistrate. He'll subscribe to the hounds. He'll
    attend to the registrations. He'll have shooting-parties in
    September. And as to any old-world, wretched talks about
    chivalry and antiquity, we'll show him that there never was a
    time like the present&mdash;commerce, land, property, and
    intelligence, all in the very best condition. We'll make Lutter
    superintendent of the whole estate, and send old Peeper about
    his business. And in all this you must help; for there's
    nothing to be done without the help of the ladies: so give me
    your hand, dear niece, and don't cry."</p>

    <p>"It would make me so happy! I would never look into Amadis
    de Gaul again!"</p>

    <p>"Hang Amadis de Gall and Amadi de Spurzheim, too! Where is
    your husband?"</p>

    <p>"I seldom see him now. He is always in the oratory with Mr
    Peeper."</p>

    <p>"The deuce he is!" said the uncle. "And how do you get on in
    other respects? Are you
    comfortable&mdash;happy&mdash;contented?" Jane told him all she
    had encountered since she had come to the castle, and the uncle
    seemed thunderstruck at the recital.</p>

    <p>"Well! bold measures are always the best," he said at last;
    "I'll kick Peeper into the moat!" and before his niece could
    interfere, the uncle had rushed across the quadrangle, guided,
    we are sorry to say, by Mr Lutter, and, grasping the venerable
    Peeper, whom he met near the drawbridge, he dragged him towards
    the water.</p>

    <p>Jane ran to get assistance for the unfortunate victim; and
    crying "Help! help!" as she saw the wretched man forced over
    the walls, she looked in a state of distraction towards her
    husband. "Dear Jane," said that individual, smiling blandly, "I
    told you you had overtired yourself with walking." Jane gazed
    round; there was Reginald sitting beside her, with her head
    reclining on his shoulder, at the open window of the inn in
    Wales. The vale of Cwmcwyllchly was spread in a beautiful
    landscape below. They were still on their wedding tour.</p>

    <p>"You have been asleep, Jane," said Reginald.</p>

    <p>"And have had such dreadful dreams. Oh, Reginald! I have had
    such visions of horrid things and people. I shall never be
    romantic again about chivalry. Such coarseness!&mdash;such
    slavery!&mdash;such ignorance! Ah, how happy we ought to be
    that we are born in a civilized time, with no Mr Peepers for
    father confessors, nor fighting with firebrands for
    amusement!"</p>

    <p>"You have been reading <i>Hallam's Middle Ages</i>&mdash;a
    present from your uncle Samson&mdash;till you have become a
    right-down Utilitarian. Come, let us ring for tea; and
    to-morrow we must start for Yorkshire! The Quarter-sessions are
    coming on."</p>

    <h2>DUMAS IN HIS CURRICLE.</h2>

    <p>We left M. Dumas at Marseilles: we find him again at Naples.
    Three volumes are the result of his visit to the last named
    city&mdash;volumes in which he manages to put a little of every
    thing, and a good deal of some things. Antiquarian, historian,
    virtuoso, novelist, he touches upon all subjects, flying from
    one to the other with a lightness and a facility of transition
    peculiarly his own, and peculiarly agreeable. English
    travellers and Italian composers, St Januarius and the opera,
    Masaniello and the <i>gettatura</i>, Pompeii, princes, police
    spies, Vesuvius, all have their turn&mdash;M. Dumas, with his
    usual tact, merely glancing at those subjects which are known
    and written about by every tourist, but giving himself full
    scope when he gets off the beaten track. His book is literally
    crammed with tales and anecdotes, to such a degree indeed, and
    most of them so good, that our principal difficulty in
    commencing a notice of it, is to know where to pick and choose
    our extracts; <i>l'embarras des richesses</i>, in short. The
    best way will probably be to begin at the beginning, and go as
    far as our limits allow us, referring our readers to the
    original for the many good things that want of space will
    compel us to exclude.</p>

    <p>M. Dumas calls his book the <i>Corricolo</i>, and devotes a
    short and characteristic preface to an explanation of the
    title. This explanation we must give in his own words. It is so
    highly graphic, that, after reading it, we fancied we had seen
    a picture of what it describes.</p>

    <p>"A <i>corricolo</i> is a sort of tilbury or gig, originally
    intended to hold one person, and be drawn by one horse. At
    Naples they harness two horses to it; and it conveys twelve or
    fifteen individuals, not at a walk nor at a trot, but at full
    gallop, and this, notwithstanding that only one of the horses
    does any work. The shaft horse draws, but the other, which is
    harnessed abreast of him, and called the <i>bilancino</i>,
    prances and curvets about, animates his companion, but does
    nothing else.</p>

    <p>"Having said that the gig built to carry one is made to
    carry fifteen, I am, of course, expected to explain how this is
    accomplished. There is an old French proverb, according to
    which, when there is enough for one there is enough for two;
    but I am not aware of any proverb in any language which says,
    that when there is enough for one, there is enough for fifteen.
    Nevertheless, it is the case with the <i>corricolo</i>. In the
    present advanced state of civilization, every thing is diverted
    from its primitive destination. As it is impossible to say at
    what period, or in how long a time, the capacity of the vehicle
    in question was extended in the ratio of one to fifteen, I must
    content myself with describing the way of packing the
    passengers.</p>

    <p>"In the first place, there is almost invariably a fat greasy
    monk seated in the middle, forming the centre of a sort of coil
    of human creatures. On one of his knees is some robust
    rosy-cheeked nurse from Aversa or Nettuno; on the other, a
    handsome peasant woman from Bauci or Procida. On either side of
    him, between the wheels and the body of the vehicle, stand the
    husbands of these two ladies. Standing on tiptoe behind the
    monk is the driver, holding in his left hand the reins, and in
    his right the long whip with which he keeps his horses at an
    equal rate of speed. Behind <i>him</i> are two or three
    lazzaroni, who get up and down, go away, and are succeeded by
    others, without any body taking notice of them, or expecting
    them to pay for their ride. On the shafts are seated two boys,
    picked up on the road from Torre del Greco or Pouzzoles,
    probably supernumerary <i>ciceroni</i> of the antiquities of
    Herculaneum and Pompeii. Finally, suspended under the carriage,
    in a sort of coarse rope network with large meshes, which
    swings backwards and forwards at every movement of the vehicle,
    is a shapeless and incomprehensible mass, which cries, laughs,
    sings, screams, shouts, and bellows, all by turns and none for
    long together, and the nature of which it is impossible to
    distinguish, dimly seen as it is through the clouds of dust
    raised by the horses' feet. This mass consists of three or four
    children, who belong to Heaven knows who, are going Heaven
    knows where, live Heaven knows how, and are there Heaven knows
    wherefore.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page348"
       name="page348"></a>[pg 348]</span> "Now then, put down, one
       above the other, monk, women, husbands, driver, lazzaroni,
       boys and children; add them up, include the infant in arms,
       which has been forgotten, and the total will be fifteen.</p>

    <p>"It sometimes happens that the <i>coricolo</i> passes over a
    big stone, and upsets, pitching out its occupants to a greater
    or less distance, according to their respective gravity. But,
    on such occasions, nobody thinks of himself; the attention of
    every one is immediately turned to the monk. If he is hurt, the
    journey is over for the day; they carry him to the nearest
    house; the horses are put into the stable, and he is put to
    bed; the women nurse him, make much of him, cry and pray over
    him. If, on the other hand, the monk is safe and sound, nobody
    has a right to complain; he resumes his seat, the nurse and the
    peasant woman resume theirs, the others climb up into their
    respective places&mdash;a crack of the long whip, and a shout
    from the driver, and the <i>corricolo</i> is off again full
    speed."</p>

    <p>From this we learn what a <i>corricolo</i> is, but we have
    not yet been told why M. Dumas should christen his book after
    the degenerate descendant of the Roman curriculum.
    Patience&mdash;we shall get to it in time. Materials crowd upon
    our traveller, and it is only in the second chapter that the
    desired explanation is given. In the first we are informed of
    M. Dumas's installation at the Hotel Vittoria, kept by M.
    Martin Zill, who, besides being an innkeeper, is a man of much
    taste in art, a distinguished antiquary, an amateur of
    pictures, a collector of autographs and curiosities. Apropos of
    the hotel we have an anecdote of the ex-dey of Algiers, who, on
    being dispossessed of his dominions by the French, took refuge
    at Naples, and established himself under M. Zill's hospitable
    roof. The third floor was entirely occupied by his suite and
    attendants, the fourth was for himself and his treasures, the
    fifth, or the garrets, he converted into his harem. The curious
    arms, costumes, and jewels which Hussein Pacha had brought with
    him, were a godsend to the virtuoso weary of examining and
    admiring them; and, before the African had been a week in the
    house, he and his host were sworn friends. Unfortunately this
    harmony was not destined to last very long.</p>

    <p>"One morning Hussein Pacha's cook (a Nubian as black as ink,
    and as shining as if he had been polished with a shoe-brush)
    entered the kitchen of the hotel, and asked for the largest
    knife they had. The head-cook gave him a sort of carving-knife,
    some eighteen inches long, sharp as a razor, and pliant as a
    foil. The negro looked at it, shook his head as if in doubt
    whether it would do, but nevertheless took it up stairs with
    him. Presently he brought it down again, and asked for a larger
    one. The cook opened all his drawers, and at last found a sort
    of cutlass, which he hardly ever used on account of its
    enormous size. With this the Nubian appeared more satisfied,
    and again went up stairs. Five minutes afterwards he came down
    for the third time, and returned the knife, asking for a bigger
    one still. The cook's curiosity was excited, and he enquired
    who wanted the knife, and for what purpose.</p>

    <p>"The African told him very coolly that the dey, having left
    his dominions rather in a hurry, had forgotten to bring an
    executioner with him, and had consequently ordered his cook to
    get a large knife and cut off the head of Osmin, chief of the
    eunuchs, who was convicted of having kept such negligent watch
    and ward over his highness's seraglio, that some presumptuous
    Giaour had made a hole in the wall, and established a
    communication with Zaida, the dey's favourite <i>odalisque</i>.
    Accordingly Osmin was to be decapitated; and as to the
    offending lady, the next time the dey took an airing in the bay
    of Naples, she would be put into the boat in a sack, and
    consigned to the keeping of the kelpies. Thunderstruck at such
    summary proceedings, the cook desired his Nubian brother to
    wait while he went for a larger knife; then hastening to M.
    Martin Zill, he told him what he had just heard.</p>

    <p>"M. Martin Zill ran to the minister of police, and laid the
    matter before him. His excellency got into his carriage
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page349"
       name="page349"></a>[pg 349]</span> and went to call upon the
       dey.</p>

    <p>He found his highness reclining upon a divan, his back
    supported by cushions, smoking latakia in a chibouque, while an
    icoglan scratched the soles of his feet, and two slaves fanned
    him. The minister made his three salaams; the dey nodded his
    head.</p>

    <p>"'Your highness,' said his excellency, 'I am the minister of
    police.'</p>

    <p>"'I know you are,' answered the dey.</p>

    <p>"'Then your highness probably conjectures the motive of my
    visit.'</p>

    <p>"'No. But you are welcome all the same.'</p>

    <p>"'I come to prevent your highness from committing a
    crime.'</p>

    <p>"'A crime! And what crime?' said the dey, taking the pipe
    from his mouth, and gazing at his interlocutor in the most
    profound astonishment.</p>

    <p>"'I wonder your highness should ask the question,' replied
    the minister. 'Is it not your intention to cut off Osmin's
    head?'</p>

    <p>"'That is no crime,' answered the dey.</p>

    <p>"'Does not your highness purpose throwing Zaida into the
    sea?'</p>

    <p>"'That is no crime,' repeated the dey. 'I bought Osmin for
    five hundred piasters, and Zaida for a thousand sequins, just
    as I bought this pipe for a hundred ducats.'</p>

    <p>"'Well,' said the minister, 'what does your highness deduce
    from that?'</p>

    <p>"'That as this pipe belongs to me, as I have bought it and
    paid for it, I may break it to atoms if I choose, and nobody
    has a right to object.' So saying, the pacha broke his pipe,
    and threw the fragments into the middle of the room.</p>

    <p>"'All very well, as far as a pipe goes,' said the minister;
    'but Osmin, but Zaida?'</p>

    <p>"'Less than a pipe,' said the dey gravely.</p>

    <p>"'How! less than a pipe! A man less than a pipe! A woman
    less than a pipe!'</p>

    <p>"'Osmin is not a man, and Zaida is not a woman: they are
    slaves. I will cut off Osmin's head, and throw Zaida into the
    sea.'</p>

    <p>"'No!' said the magistrate. 'Not at Naples at least.'</p>

    <p>"'Dog of a Christian!' shouted the dey, 'do you know who I
    am?'</p>

    <p>"'You are the ex-dey of Algiers, and I am the Neapolitan
    minister of police; and, if your deyship is impertinent, I
    shall send him to prison,' added the minister very coolly.</p>

    <p>"'To prison!' repeated the dey, falling back upon his
    divan.</p>

    <p>"'To prison,' replied the minister.</p>

    <p>"'Very well,' said Hussein. 'I leave Naples to-night.'</p>

    <p>"'Your highness is as free as air to go and to come.
    Nevertheless, I must make one condition. Before your departure,
    you will swear by the Prophet, that no harm shall be done to
    Osmin or Zaida.'</p>

    <p>"'Osmin and Zaida belong to me, and I shall do what I please
    with them.'</p>

    <p>"'Then your highness will be pleased to deliver them over to
    me, to be punished according to the laws of the country; and,
    until you do so, you will not be allowed to leave Naples.'</p>

    <p>"'Who will prevent me?'</p>

    <p>"'I will.'</p>

    <p>"The pacha laid his hand on his dagger. The minister stepped
    to the window and made a sign. The next moment the tramp of
    heavy boots and jingle of spurs were heard upon the stairs; the
    door opened, and a gigantic corporal of gendarmes made his
    appearance, his right hand raised to his cocked hat, his left
    upon the seam of his trouser.</p>

    <p>"'Gennaro,' said the minister of police, 'if I gave you an
    order to arrest this gentleman, would you see any difficulty in
    executing it?'</p>

    <p>"'None, your excellency.'</p>

    <p>"'You are aware that this gentleman's name is Hussein
    Pacha.'</p>

    <p>"'I was not, your excellency.'</p>

    <p>"'And that he is dey of Algiers.'</p>

    <p>"'May it please your excellency, I don't know what that
    is.'</p>

    <p>"'You see?' said the minister, turning to the dey.</p>

    <p>"'The devil! exclaimed Hussein.</p>

    <p>"'Shall I?' said Gennaro, taking a pair of handcuffs from
    his pocket, and advancing a pace towards the dey, who, on his
    part, took a step backwards.</p>

    <p>"'No,' replied the minister, 'it will not be necessary. His
    highness <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350"
       name="page350"></a>[pg 350]</span> will do as he is bid. Go
       and search the hotel for a man named Osmin, and a woman
       named Zaida, and take them both to the prefecture.'</p>

    <p>"'What!' cried the dey; 'this man is to enter my harem?'</p>

    <p>"'He is not a man,' replied the minister; 'he is a corporal
    of gendarmes. But if you do not wish him to go, send for Osmin
    and Zaida yourself.'</p>

    <p>"'Will you promise to have them punished?' enquired the
    dey.</p>

    <p>"'Certainly; according to the utmost rigour of the law.'</p>

    <p>"Hussein Pacha clapped his hands. A door concealed behind a
    tapestry was opened, and a slave entered the room.</p>

    <p>"'Bring down Osmin and Zaida,' said the dey.</p>

    <p>"The slave crossed his hands on his breast, bowed his head,
    and disappeared without uttering a word. The next instant he
    came back with the two culprits.</p>

    <p>"The eunuch was a little round fat fellow, with beardless
    face, and small hands and feet. Zaida was a beautiful
    Circassian, her eyelids painted with kool, her teeth blackened
    with betel, her nails reddened with henna. On perceiving
    Hussein Pacha, the eunuch fell upon his knees; Zaida raised her
    head. The dey's eyes flashed, and he clutched the hilt of his
    kangiar. Osmin grew pale; Zaida smiled. The minister of police
    made a sign to the gendarme, who stepped up to the two
    captives, handcuffed them, and led them out of the room. As the
    door closed behind them, the dey uttered a sound between a sigh
    and a roar.</p>

    <p>"The magistrate looked out of the window, till he saw the
    prisoners and their escort disappear at the corner of the
    Strada Chiatamone. Then turning to the dey&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'Your highness is now at liberty to leave Naples, if he
    wishes so to do,' said the imperturbable functionary with a low
    bow.</p>

    <p>"'This very instant!' cried Hussein. 'I will not remain
    another moment in such a barbarous country as yours.'</p>

    <p>"'A pleasant journey to your highness,' said the
    minister.</p>

    <p>"'Go to the devil!' retorted Hussein.</p>

    <p>"Before an hour had elapsed, the dey had chartered a small
    vessel, on board of which he embarked the same evening with his
    suite, his wives, and his treasures; and at midnight he set
    sail; cursing the tyranny that prevented a man from drowning
    his wife and cutting off the heads of his slaves. The next day
    the minister of police had the culprits brought before him and
    examined. Osmin was found guilty of having slept when he ought
    to have watched, and Zaida of having watched when she ought to
    have slept. But, by some strange omission, the Neapolitan code
    allots no punishment to such offences; and, consequently, Osmin
    and Zaida, to their infinite astonishment, were immediately set
    at liberty. Osmin took to selling pastilles for a livelihood,
    and the lady got employment as <i>dame de comptoir</i> in a
    coffeehouse. As to the dey, he had left Naples with the
    intention of going to England, in which country, as he had been
    informed, a man is at liberty to sell his wife, if he may not
    drown her. He was taken ill, however, on the road, and obliged
    to stop at Leghorn, where he died."</p>

    <p>M. Dumas, not being in good odour with the Neapolitan
    authorities, on account of some supposed republican tendencies
    of his, is at Naples under an assumed name; and, as it is
    uncertain how long he may be able to preserve his incognito, he
    is desirous of seeing all that is to be seen in as short a time
    as possible. He finds that Naples, independently of its
    suburbs, consists of three streets where every body goes, and
    five hundred streets where nobody goes. The three streets are,
    the Chiaja, the Toledo, and the Forcella; the five hundred
    others are nameless&mdash;a labyrinth of houses, which might be
    compared to that of Crete, deducting the Minotaur, and adding
    the Lazzaroni. There are three ways of seeing Naples&mdash;on
    foot, in a <i>corricolo</i> or in a carriage. On foot, one goes
    every where, but one sees too much; in a carriage, one only
    goes through the three principal streets, and one sees too
    little&mdash;the <i>corricolo</i> is the happy medium, the
    <i>juste milieu</i>, to which M. Dumas for <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page351"
       name="page351"></a>[pg 351]</span> once determines to
       adhere. Having made up his mind, he sends for his host, and
       enquires where he can hire a <i>corricolo</i> by the week or
       month. His host tells him he had better buy one, horse and
       all. To this plan M. Dumas objects the expense.</p>

    <p>"'It will cost you,' said M. Martin, after a momentary
    calculation in his head, 'it will cost you&mdash;the
    <i>corricolo</i> ten ducats, each horse thirty carlini, the
    harness a pistole; in all, eighty French francs.'</p>

    <p>"'What! for ten ducats I shall have a <i>corricolo</i>?'</p>

    <p>"'A magnificent one.'</p>

    <p>"'New?'</p>

    <p>"'Oh! you are asking too much. There are no such things as
    new <i>corricoli</i>. There is a standing order of the police
    forbidding coachmakers to build them.'</p>

    <p>"'Indeed! How long has that order been in force?'</p>

    <p>"'Fifty years, perhaps.'</p>

    <p>"'How comes it, then, that there is such a thing as a
    <i>corricolo</i> in existence?'</p>

    <p>"'Nothing easier. You know the story of Jeannot's
    knife?'</p>

    <p>"'To be sure I do; it is one of our national chronicles. The
    blade had been changed fifteen times, and the handle fifteen
    times, but it was still the same knife.'</p>

    <p>"'The case of the <i>corricolo</i> is exactly similar. It is
    forbidden to build new ones, but it is not forbidden to put new
    wheels to old bodies, and new bodies on old wheels. By these
    means the <i>corricolo</i> becomes immortal.'</p>

    <p>"'I understand. An old body and new wheels for me, if you
    please. But the horses? Do you mean to say that for thirty
    francs I shall have a pair of horses?'</p>

    <p>"'A superb pair, that will go like the wind.'</p>

    <p>"'What sort of horses?'</p>

    <p>"'Oh, dead ones, of course!'</p>

    <p>"'Dead ones!'</p>

    <p>"'Certainly. At that price you could hardly expect any thing
    better.'</p>

    <p>"'My dear M. Martin, be kind enough to explain. I am
    travelling for my improvement, and information of all kinds is
    highly acceptable.'</p>

    <p>"'You are acquainted with the history of the horse, I
    suppose?'</p>

    <p>"'The natural history? Buffon's? Certainly. The horse is,
    after the lion, the noblest of all the beasts.'</p>

    <p>"'No, no; the philosophical history. The different stages
    and vicissitudes in the existence of those noble
    quadrupeds.'</p>

    <p>"'Oh yes! first the saddle, then a carriage or gig, thence
    to a stage-coach or omnibus, hackney-coach or cab, and
    finally&mdash;to the knacker's.'</p>

    <p>"'And from the knacker's?'</p>

    <p>"'To the Elysian fields, I suppose.'</p>

    <p>"'No. Not here, at least. From the knacker's they go to the
    <i>corricoli</i>.'</p>

    <p>"'How so?'</p>

    <p>"'I will tell you. At the Ponte della Maddalena, where
    horses are taken to be killed, there are always persons
    waiting, who, when a horse is brought, buy the hide and hoofs
    for thirty carlini, which is the price regulated by law.
    Instead of killing the horse and skinning him, these persons
    take him with the skin on, and make the most of the time he yet
    has to live. They are sure of getting the skin sooner or later.
    And these are what I mean by dead horses.'</p>

    <p>"'But what can they possibly do with the unfortunate
    brutes?'</p>

    <p>"'They harness them to the <i>corricoli</i>.'</p>

    <p>"'What! those with which I came from Salerno to
    Naples'&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'Were the ghosts of horses; spectre steeds, in short.'</p>

    <p>"'But they galloped the whole way.'</p>

    <p>"'Why not? <i>Les morts vont vite.</i>'"</p>

    <p><i>Et cetera, et cetera</i>. For the price stated by his
    host, M. Dumas finds himself possessor of a magnificent
    <i>corricolo</i> of a bright red colour, with green trees and
    animals painted thereon. Two most fiery and impatient steeds,
    half concealed by harness, bells, and ribands, are included in
    his purchase. After a vain attempt to drive himself, the
    phantom coursers having apparently a supreme contempt for
    whipcord, he gives up the reins to a professional charioteer,
    and commences his perambulations. His first visit is to the
    Chiaja, the favourite promenade of the aristocracy and of
    foreigners; his second to the Toledo, the street of shops and
    loungers; his third <span class="pagenum"><a id="page352"
       name="page352"></a>[pg 352]</span> to the Forcella,
       frequented by lawyers and their clients. He makes a chapter,
       and a long one too, out of each street; but not in the way
       usually adopted by those pitiless tour-writers who overwhelm
       their readers with dry architectural details, filling a page
       with a portico, and a chapter with a chapel&mdash;not
       letting one off a pane of a painted window or line of
       worm-eaten inscription however often those things may have
       been described already by previous travellers. M. Dumas
       prefers men to things as subjects for his pen; and the three
       chapters above named are filled with curious illustrations
       of Neapolitan manners, customs, and character. Apropos of
       the Toledo, we are introduced to the well-known
       <i>impresario</i>, Domenico Barbaja, who had his palazzo in
       that street, and who, from being waiter in a coffeehouse at
       Milan, became the manager of three theatres at one time,
       namely, San Carlo, La Scala, and the Vienna opera. He
       appears to have been a man of great energy and originality
       of character, concealing an excellent heart under the
       roughest manners and most choleric of tempers.</p>

    <p>"It would be impossible," says M. Dumas, "to translate into
    any language the abuse with which Barbaja used to overwhelm the
    singers and musicians at his theatres when they displeased him.
    Yet not one of them bore him malice for it, knowing that, if
    they had the least triumph, Barbaja would be the first to
    embrace and congratulate them: if they were unsuccessful, he
    would console them with the utmost delicacy: if they were ill,
    he would watch over them with the tenderness of a father or
    brother. The fortune which he had amassed, little by little,
    and by strenuous exertions, he spent in the most generous and
    princely manner. His palace, his villa, and his table, were
    open to all.</p>

    <p>"His genius was of a peculiar and extraordinary kind.
    Education he had none: he was unable to write the commonest
    letter, and did not know a note of music; yet he would give his
    composers the most valuable hints, and dictate with admirable
    skill the plan of a libretto. His own voice was of the harshest
    and most inharmonious texture; but by his advice and
    instructions he formed some of the first singers in Italy. His
    language was a Milanese patois; but he found means to make
    himself excellently understood by the kings and emperors, with
    whom he carried on negotiations upon a footing of perfect
    equality. It was a great treat to see him seated in his box at
    San Carlo, opposite that of the King of Naples, on the evening
    of a new opera; with grave and impartial aspect, now turning
    his face to the actors, then to the audience. If a singer went
    wrong, Barbaja was the first to crush him with a severity
    worthy of Brutus. His '<i>Can de Dio</i>!' was shouted out in a
    voice that made the theatre shake and the poor actor tremble.
    If, on the other hand, the public disapproved without reason,
    Barbaja would start up in his box and address the audience.
    '<i>Figli d'una racca</i>!' 'Will you hold your tongues? You
    don't deserve good singers.' If by chance the King himself
    omitted to applaud at the right time, Barbaja would shrug his
    shoulders and go grumbling out of his box.</p>

    <p>"With all his peculiarities, he it was who formed and
    brought forward Lablache, Tamburini, Rubini, Donzelli, Colbran,
    Pasta, Fodor, Donizetti, Bellini, and the great Rossini
    himself, whose masterpieces were composed for Barbaja. It is
    impossible to form an idea of the amount of entreaties,
    stratagems, and even violence, expended by the
    <i>impresario</i> to make Rossini work. I will give an example
    of it, which is highly characteristic both of the manager and
    of the greatest and happiest, but most <i>insouciant</i> and
    idle, musical genius that ever drew breath under the bright sky
    of Italy."</p>

    <p>We are sorry to tantalize our readers, but we have not space
    for the story that follows. It relates to the opera of
    <i>Othello</i>, which was composed by Rossini in an incredibly
    short time, whilst a prisoner in an apartment of Barbaja's
    house. For nearly six months had the composer been living vith
    the manager, entertaining his friends at his well-spread table,
    drinking his choicest wines, and occupying his best
    rooms&mdash;all this under promise of producing a new opera
    within the half-year, a promise which <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page353"
       name="page353"></a>[pg 353]</span> he showed little
       disposition to fulfil. Barbaja was in a fever of anxiety,
       and finding remonstrance unavailing, had recourse to
       stratagem. One morning, when Rossini was about to start on a
       party of pleasure, he found his doors secured outside; and,
       on putting his head out of the window, was informed by
       Barbaja that he must remain captive until his ransom was
       paid. The ransom, of course, was the opera.</p>

    <p>Rossini subsequently revenges himself on his tyrant in a
    very piquant manner; and, finally, the morning after
    <i>Othello</i> has been performed with triumphant success, he
    starts for Bologna, taking with him, as travelling companion,
    the <i>prima donna</i> of the San Carlo theatre, Signora
    Colbran, whom he had privately married. All this is related
    very amusingly by M. Dumas, but at too great length for our
    limits.</p>

    <p>We have a naval combat in the second volume, in which a
    French frigate is attacked by two English line-of-battle ships,
    one of which she sinks, and receives in return the entire
    point-blank broadside of the other, a three-decker; which
    broadside, we in our ignorance of nautical matters, should have
    thought sufficient to blow her either out of the water or under
    it. It has not that effect, however, and the frigate is
    captured; the captain of her, when he has hauled down his flag
    in order to save the lives of his men, stepping into his cabin
    and blowing his brains out. All this is very pretty, whatever
    may be said of its probability. But there are two subjects on
    which the majority of Frenchmen indulge in most singular
    delusions. These are, their invincibility upon the sea, and the
    battle of Waterloo. M. Dumas has not escaped the national
    monomania.</p>

    <p>Our author is very hard upon the poor English in this book.
    He attacks them on all sides and with all weapons. Nelson and
    Lady Hamilton occupy a prominent position in his pages. The
    execution of Admiral Carraciolo, an undoubted blot on the
    character of our naval hero, is given in all its details, and
    with some little decorations and embellishments, for which we
    suspect that we have to thank our imaginative historian.
    Nelson's weakness, the ascendency exercised over him by Lady
    Hamilton, or Emma Lyonna, as M. Dumas prefers styling her, her
    intimacy with the Queen of Naples, and subservient to the
    wishes and interests of the Neapolitan court, are all set forth
    in the most glowing colours. This is the heavy artillery, the
    round-shot and shell; but M. Dumas is too skilful a general to
    leave any part of his forces unemployed, and does not omit to
    bring up his sharpshooters, and open a pretty little fire of
    ridicule upon English travellers in Italy, who, as it is well
    known, go thither to make the fortunes of innkeepers and
    purchase antiquities manufactured in the nineteenth century.
    Strange as it may appear, we should be heartily sorry if M.
    Dumas were to exchange his evident dislike of us for a more
    kindly feeling. We should then lose some of his best stories;
    for he is never more rich and amusing than when he shows up the
    sons and daughters of <i>le perfide Albion</i>. In support of
    our assertion, take the following sketch:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"During my stay at Naples an Englishman arrived there, and
    took up his quarters at the hotel at which I was stopping. He
    was one of those phlegmatic, overbearing, obstinate Britons,
    who consider money the engine with which every thing is to be
    moved and all things accomplished, the argument in short which
    nothing can resist. Money was every thing in his estimation of
    mankind; talent, fame, titles, mere feathers that kicked the
    beam the moment a long rent-roll or inscription of three per
    cents were placed in the opposite scale. In proportion as men
    were rich or poor, did he esteem them much or little. Being
    very rich himself, he esteemed himself much.</p>

    <p>"He had come direct to Naples by steam, and during the
    voyage had made this calculation: With money I shall say every
    thing, do every thing, and have every thing I please. He had
    not long to wait to find out his mistake. The steamer cast
    anchor in the port of Naples just half an hour too late for the
    passengers to land. The Englishman, who had been very sea-sick,
    and was particularly anxious to get on shore, sent to offer the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354"
       name="page354"></a>[pg 354]</span> captain of the port a
       hundred guineas if he would let him land directly. The
       quarantine laws of Naples are very strict; the captain of
       the port thought the Englishman was mad, and only laughed at
       his offer. He was therefore obliged to sleep on board in an
       excessively bad humour, cursing alike those who made the
       regulations and those who enforced them.</p>

    <p>"The first thing he did when he got on shore, was to set off
    to visit the ruins of Pompeii. There happened to be no regular
    guide at hand, so he took a lazzarone instead. He had not
    forgotten his disappointment of the night before, and all the
    way to Pompeii he relieved his mind by abusing King Ferdinand
    in the best Italian he could muster. The lazzarone, whom he had
    taken into his carriage, took no notice of all this so long as
    they were on the high-road. Lazzaroni, in general, meddle very
    little in politics, and do not care how much you abuse king or
    kaiser so long as nothing disrespectful is said of the Virgin
    Mary, St Januarius, or Mount Vesuvius. On arriving, however, at
    the <i>Via dei Sepolchri</i>, the ragged guide put his finger
    on his lips as a signal to be silent. But his employer either
    did not understand the gesture, or considered it beneath his
    dignity to take notice of it, for he continued his invectives
    against Ferdinand the Well-beloved.</p>

    <p>"'Pardon me, Eccellenza,' said the lazzarone at last,
    placing his hand upon the side of the barouche, and jumping out
    as lightly as a harlequin. 'Pardon me, Eccellenza, but I must
    return to Naples.'</p>

    <p>"'And why so?' inquired the other in his broken Italian.</p>

    <p>"'Because I do not wish to be hung.'</p>

    <p>"'And who would dare to hang you?'</p>

    <p>"'The king.'</p>

    <p>"'Why?'</p>

    <p>"'Because you are speaking ill of him.'</p>

    <p>"'An Englishman has a right to say whatever he likes.'</p>

    <p>"'It may be so, but a lazzarone has not.'</p>

    <p>"'But you have said nothing.'</p>

    <p>"'But I hear everything.'</p>

    <p>"'Who will tell what you hear?'</p>

    <p>"'The invalid soldier who accompanies us to visit
    Pompeii.'</p>

    <p>"'I do not want an invalid soldier.'</p>

    <p>"'Then you cannot visit Pompeii.'</p>

    <p>"'Not by paying?'</p>

    <p>"'No.'</p>

    <p>"'But I will pay double, treble, four times, whatever they
    ask.'</p>

    <p>"'No, no, no.'</p>

    <p>"'Oh!' said the Englishman, and he fell into a brown study,
    during which the lazzarone amused himself by trying to jump
    over his own shadow.</p>

    <p>"'I will take the invalid,' said the Englishman after a
    little reflection.</p>

    <p>"'Very good,' replied the lazzarone, 'we will take him.'</p>

    <p>"'But I shall say just what I please before him.'</p>

    <p>"'In that case I wish you a good morning.'</p>

    <p>"'No, no; you must remain.'</p>

    <p>"'Allow me to give you a piece of advice then. If you want
    to say what you please before the invalid, take a deaf
    one.'</p>

    <p>"'Ooh!' cried the Englishman, delighted with the advice, 'by
    all means a deaf one. Here is a piaster for you for having
    thought of it.' The lazzarone ran to the guard-house, and soon
    returned with an old soldier who was as deaf as a post.</p>

    <p>"They began the usual round of the curiosities, during which
    the Englishman continued calling King Ferdinand any thing but a
    gentleman, of all which the invalid heard nothing, and the
    lazzarone took no notice. They visited the Via dei Sepolchri,
    the houses of Diomedes and Cicero. At last they came to
    Sallust's house, in one of the rooms of which was a fresco that
    hit the Englishman's fancy exceedingly. He immediately sat
    down, took a pencil and a blank book from his pocket, and began
    copying it. He had scarcely made a stroke, however, when the
    soldier and the lazzarone approached him. The former was going
    to speak, but the latter took the words out of his mouth.</p>

    <p>"'Eccellenza,' said he, 'it is forbidden to copy the
    fresco.'</p>

    <p>"'Oh!' said the Englishman, 'I must make this copy. I will
    pay for it.'</p>

    <p>"'It is not allowed, even if you pay.'</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page355"
       name="page355"></a>[pg 355]</span> "'But I will pay ten
       times its value if necessary; I must copy it, it is so
       funny.'</p>

    <p>"'If you do, the invalid will put you in the
    guard-room.'</p>

    <p>"'Pshaw! An Englishman has a right to draw any thing he
    likes.' And he went on with his sketch. The invalid approached
    him with an inexorable countenance.</p>

    <p>"'Pardon me, Eccellenza,' said the lazzarone; 'but would you
    like to copy not only this fresco, but as many more as you
    please?'</p>

    <p>"'Certainly I should, and I will too.'</p>

    <p>"'Then, let me give you a word of advice. Take a blind
    invalid.'</p>

    <p>"'Ooh!' cried the Englishman, still more enchanted with this
    second hint than with the first. 'By all means, a blind
    invalid. Here are two piasters for the idea.'</p>

    <p>"They left Sallust's house, the deaf man was paid and
    discharged, and the lazzarone went to the guard-room, and
    brought back an invalid who was stone-blind and led by a black
    poodle.</p>

    <p>"The Englishman wished to return immediately to continue his
    drawing, but the lazzarone persuaded him to delay it, in order
    to avoid exciting suspicion. They continued their rambles,
    therefore, guided by the invalid, or rather by his dog, who
    displayed a knowledge of Pompeii that might have qualified him
    to become a member of the antiquarian society. After visiting
    the blacksmith's shop, Fortunata's house, and the public oven,
    they returned to the abode of Sallust, where the Englishman
    finished his sketch, while the lazzarone chatted with the blind
    man, and kept him amused. Continuing their lounge, he made a
    number of other drawings, and in a couple of hours his book was
    half full.</p>

    <p>"At last they arrived at a place where men were digging.
    There had been discovered a number of small busts and statues,
    bronzes, and curiosities of all kinds, which, as soon as they
    were dug up, were carried into a neighbouring house, and had
    his attention speedily attracted by a little statue of a satyr
    about six inches high. 'Oh!' cried he, 'I shall buy this
    figure.'</p>

    <p>"'The king of Naples does not wish to sell it,' replied the
    lazzarone.</p>

    <p>"'I will give its weight in sovereigns&mdash;double its
    weight even.'</p>

    <p>"'I tell you it is not to be sold,' persisted the lazzarone;
    'but,' added he, changing his tone, 'I have already given your
    excellence two pieces of advice which you liked, I will now
    give you a third: Do not buy the statue&mdash;steal it.'</p>

    <p>"'Oh&mdash;oh! that will be very original, and we have a
    blind invalid too. Capital!'</p>

    <p>"'Yes, but the invalid has a dog, who has two good eyes and
    sixteen good teeth, and who will fly at you if you so much as
    touch any thing with your little finger.'</p>

    <p>"'I'll buy the dog, and hang him.'</p>

    <p>"'Do better still; take a lame invalid. Then, as you have
    seen nearly every thing here, put the figure in your pocket and
    run away. He may call out as much as he likes, he will not be
    able to run after you.'</p>

    <p>"'Ooh!' cried the Englishman, in convulsions of delight,
    'here are three piasters for you. Fetch me a lame invalid.'</p>

    <p>"And in order not to excite the suspicions of the blind man
    and his dog, he left the house, and pretended to be examining a
    fountain made of shell-work, while the lazzarone went for a
    third guide. In a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied
    by an invalid with two wooden legs. They gave the blind man
    three carlini, two for him and one for his dog, and sent him
    away.</p>

    <p>"The theatre and the temple of Isis were all that now
    remained to be seen. After visiting them, the Englishman, in
    the most careless tone he could assume, said he should like to
    return to the house in which were deposited the produce of the
    researches then making. The invalid, without the slightest
    suspicion, conducted them thither, and they entered the
    apartment in which the curiosities were arranged on shelves
    nailed against the wall.</p>

    <p>"While the Englishman lounged about, pretending to be
    examining every thing with the greatest interest, the lazzarone
    busied himself in fastening a stout string across the doorway,
    at the height of a couple of feet from <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page356"
       name="page356"></a>[pg 356]</span> the ground. When he had
       done this, he made a sign to the Englishman, who seized the
       little statue that he coveted from under the very nose of
       the astounded invalid, put it into his pocket, and, jumping
       over the string, ran off as hard as he could, accompanied by
       the lazzarone. Darting through the Stabian gate, they found
       themselves on the Salerno road&mdash;an empty hackney-coach
       was passing, the Englishman jumped in, and had soon rejoined
       his carriage, which was waiting for him in Via dei
       Sepolchri. Two hours after he had left Pompeii he was at
       Torre del Greco, and in another hour at Naples.</p>

    <p>"As to the invalid, he at first tried to step over the cord
    fastened across the door, but the height at which the lazzarone
    had fixed it was too great for wooden legs to accomplish. He
    then endeavoured to untie it, but with no better success; for
    the lazzarone had fastened it in a knot compared to which the
    one of Gordian celebrity would have appeared a mere slip-knot.
    Finally, the old soldier, who had perhaps read of Alexander the
    Great, determined to cut what he could not untie, and
    accordingly drew his sword. But the sword in its best days had
    never had much edge, and now it had none at all; so that the
    Englishman was halfway to Naples whilst the invalid was still
    sawing away at his cord.</p>

    <p>"The same evening the Englishman left Naples on board a
    steamboat, and the lazzarone was lost in the crowd of his
    comrades; the six plasters he had got from his employer
    enabling him to live in what a lazzarone considers luxury for
    nearly as many months.</p>

    <p>"The Englishman had been twelve hours at Naples, and had
    done the three things that are most expressly forbidden to be
    done there. He had abused the king, copied frescoes, and stolen
    a statue, and all owing, not to his money, but to the ingenuity
    of a lazzarone."</p>

    <p>The lazzarone is a godsend for M. Dumas, an admirable peg
    upon which to hang his quaint conceit and sly satire; and he is
    accordingly frequently introduced in the course of the three
    volumes. We must make room for one more extract, in which he
    figures in conjunction with his friend the sbirro or gendarme,
    who before being invested with a uniform, and armed with
    carbine, pistols, and sabre, has frequently been a lazzarone
    himself, and usually preserves the instincts and tastes of his
    former station. The result of this is a coalition between the
    lazzarone and the sbirro&mdash;law-breaker and law-preserver
    uniting in a systematic attack upon the pockets of the
    public.</p>

    <p>"I was one day passing down the Toledo, when I saw a sbirro
    arrested. Like La Fontaine's huntsman, he had been insatiable,
    and his greediness brought its own punishment. This is what had
    happened.</p>

    <p>"A sbirro had caught a lazzarone in the fact.</p>

    <p>"'What did you steal from that gentleman in black, who just
    went by?' he demanded he.</p>

    <p>"'Nothing, your excellency,' replied the lazzarone. A
    lazzarone always addresses a sbirro as <i>eccellenza</i>.</p>

    <p>"'I saw your hand in his pocket.'</p>

    <p>"'His pocket was empty.'</p>

    <p>"'What! Not a purse, a snuff-box, a handkerchief?'</p>

    <p>"'Nothing, please your excellency. It was an author.'</p>

    <p>"'Why do you go to those sort of people?'</p>

    <p>"'I found out my mistake too late.'</p>

    <p>"'Come along with me to the police-office.'</p>

    <p>"'But, your excellency&mdash;since I have stolen
    nothing?'</p>

    <p>"'Idiot, that's the very reason. If you <i>had</i> stolen
    something, we might have arranged matters.'</p>

    <p>"'Only wait till next time. I shall not always be so
    unfortunate. I promise you the contents of the pocket of the
    next person who passes.'</p>

    <p>"'Very good; but I will select the individual, or else you
    will be making a bad choice again.'</p>

    <p>"'As your excellency pleases.'</p>

    <p>"The sbirro folded his arms in a most dignified manner, and
    leaned his back against a post; the lazzarone stretched himself
    on the pavement at his feet. A priest came by, then a lawyer,
    then a poet; but the sbirro made no sign. At last there
    appeared a young officer, dressed in brilliant uniform, who
    passed gaily along, humming <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page357"
       name="page357"></a>[pg 357]</span> between his teeth a tune
       out of the last opera. The sbirro gave the signal. Up sprang
       the lazzarone and followed the officer. Both disappeared
       round a corner. Presently the lazzarone returned with his
       ransom in his hand.</p>

    <p>"'What have you got there?' said the sbirro.</p>

    <p>"'A handkerchief,' replied the other.</p>

    <p>"'Is that all?'</p>

    <p>"'That all! It is of the finest cambric.'</p>

    <p>"'Had he only one?'<a id="footnotetag11"
       name="footnotetag11"></a><a href=
       "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

    <p>"'Only one in that pocket.'</p>

    <p>"'And in the other?'</p>

    <p>"'In the other he had a silk handkerchief.'</p>

    <p>"'Why didn't you bring it?'</p>

    <p>"'I keep that for myself, excellency. It is fair that we
    should divide the profits. One pocket for you, the other for
    me.'</p>

    <p>"'I have a right to both, and I must have the silk
    handkerchief.'</p>

    <p>"'But, your excelleilcy'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'I must have the silk handkerchief.'</p>

    <p>"'It is an injustice.'</p>

    <p>"'Ha! Do you dare speak ill of his majesty's sbirri? Come
    along to prison.'</p>

    <p>"'You shall have the silk handkerchief, your
    excellency.'</p>

    <p>"'How will you find the officer again?'</p>

    <p>"'He is gone to pay a visit in the Strada de Foria. I will
    go and wait for him at the door.'</p>

    <p>"The lazzarone walked away, turned the corner of the street,
    and established himself in the recess of a doorway. Presently
    the young officer came out of a house opposite, and before he
    had gone ten paces, put his hand in his pocket, and found he
    was minus a handkerchief.</p>

    <p>"'Pardon me, excellency,' said the lazzarone, stepping up to
    him; 'you have lost something, I think?'</p>

    <p>"'I have lost a cambric handkerchief.'</p>

    <p>"'Your excellency has not lost it; it has been stolen from
    him.'</p>

    <p>"'And who stole it?'</p>

    <p>"'What will your excellency give me if I find him the
    thief?'</p>

    <p>"'I will give you a piastre.'</p>

    <p>"'I must have two.'</p>

    <p>"'You shall. Hallo! What are you doing?'</p>

    <p>"'I am stealing your silk handkerchief.'</p>

    <p>"'In order to find my cambric one?'</p>

    <p>"'Yes.'</p>

    <p>"'And where will both of them be?'</p>

    <p>"'In the same pocket. The person to whom I shall give this
    handkerchief is the same to whom I have already given the
    other. Follow me, and observe what I do.'</p>

    <p>"The officer followed the lazzarone, who gave the
    handkerchief to the sbirro, and walked away. The latter had
    hardly put his prize in his pocket when the officer came up and
    seized him by the collar. The sbirro fell on his knees, but the
    officer was inexorable, and he was sent to prison. As the
    sbirro had himself been a lazzarone, he saw at once the trick
    that had been played him. He wanted to cheat his confederate,
    and his confederate had cheated him; but far from bearing him
    malice for having done so, the sbirro views the conduct of the
    lazzarone in the light of an exploit, and feels an additional
    respect for him in consequence. When he is released from
    prison, he will seek him out, and they will be hand and glove
    together. When that time comes, look to your pockets."</p>

    <p>We are introduced to Ferdinand IV. of Naples, King Nasone,
    as the lazzaroni nicknamed him; also to Padre Rocco, a popular
    preacher, and the idol of the lower classes of Neapolitans; and
    to Cardinal Perelli, remarkable for his simplicity, which
    quality, as may be supposed, loses nothing in passing through
    the hands of his present biographer. With his usual skill, M.
    Dumas glides from a ticklish story of which the cardinal is the
    hero, (a story that he does <i>not</i> tell, for which
    forbearance we give him due credit, since he is evidently
    sorely tempted thereto,) to an account of the
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page358"
       name="page358"></a>[pg 358]</span> Vardarelli, a band of
       outlaws which for some time infested Calabria and the
       Capitanato.</p>

    <p>"Gaetano Vardarelli was a native of Calabria, and one of the
    earliest members of the revolutionary society of the Carbonari.
    When Murat, after for some time favouring that society, began
    to persecute it, Vardarelli fled to Sicily, and took service
    under King Ferdinand. He was then twenty-six years of age,
    possessing the muscles and courage of a lion, the agility of a
    chamois, the eye of an eagle. Such a recruit was not to be
    despised, and he was made sergeant in the Sicilian guards. On
    Ferdinand's restoration in 1815, he followed him to Naples; but
    finding that he was not likely ever to rise above a very
    subordinate grade, he became disgusted with the service,
    deserted, and took refuge in the mountains of Calabria. There
    two of his brothers, and some thirty brigands and outlaws,
    assembled around him and elected him their chief, with right of
    life and death over them. He had been a slave in the town; he
    found himself a king in the mountains.</p>

    <p>"Proceeding according to the old formula observed by
    banditti chiefs both in Calabria and in melodramas, Vardarelli
    proclaimed himself redresser general of wrongs and grievances,
    and acted up to his profession by robbing the rich and
    assisting the poor. The consequence was, that he soon became
    exceedingly dreaded by the former, and exceedingly popular
    among the latter class; and at last his exploits reached the
    ears of King Ferdinand himself, who was highly indignant at
    such goings on, and gave orders that the bandit should
    immediately be hung. But there are three things necessary to
    hang a man&mdash;a rope, a gallows, and the man himself. In
    this instance, the first two were easily found, but the third
    was unfortunately wanting. Gendarmes and soldiers were sent
    after Vardarelli, but the latter was too cunning for them all,
    and slipped through their fingers at every turn. His success in
    eluding pursuit increased his reputation, and recruits flocked
    to his standard. His band soon doubled its numbers, and its
    leader became a formidable and important person, which of
    course was an additional reason for the authorities to wish to
    capture him. A price was set on his head, large bodies of
    troops sent in search of him, but all in vain. One day the
    Prince of Leperano, Colonel Calcedonio, Major Delponte, with a
    dozen other officers, and a score of attendants, were hunting
    in a forest a few leagues from Bari, when the cry of
    '<i>Vardarelli</i>!' was suddenly heard. The party took to
    flight with the utmost precipitation, and all escaped except
    Major Delponte, who was one of the bravest, but, at the same
    time, one of the poorest, officers of the whole army. When he
    was told that he must pay a thousand ducats for his ransom, he
    only laughed, and asked where he was to get such a sum.
    Vardarelli then threatened to shoot him if it was not
    forthcoming by a certain day. The major replied that it was
    losing time to wait; and that, if he had a piece of advice to
    give his captor, it was to shoot him at once. The bandit at
    first felt half inclined to do so; but he reflected that the
    less Delponte cared about his life, the more ought Ferdinand to
    value it. He was right in his calculation; for no sooner did
    the king learn that his brave major was in the hands of the
    banditti, than he ordered the ransom to be paid out of his
    privy purse, and the major recovered his freedom.</p>

    <p>"But Ferdinand had sworn the extermination of the banditti
    with whom he was thus obliged to treat as from one potentate to
    another. A certain colonel, whose name I forget, and who had
    heard this vow, pledged himself, if a battalion were put under
    his command, to bring in Vardarelli, his two brothers, and the
    sixty men composing his troop, bound hand and foot, and to
    place them in the dungeons of the Vicaria. The offer was too
    good to be refused; the minister of war put five hundred men at
    the disposal of the colonel, who started with them at once in
    pursuit of the outlaw. The latter was soon informed by his
    spies of this fresh expedition, and <i>he</i> also made a vow,
    to the effect that he would cure his pursuer, once and for all,
    of any disposition to interfere with the Vardarelli.</p>

    <p>"He began by leading the poor colonel such a dance over hill
    and dale, that the unfortunate officer and <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page359"
       name="page359"></a>[pg 359]</span> his men were worn out
       with fatigue; then, when he saw them in the state that he
       wished, he caused some false intelligence to be conveyed to
       them at two o'clock one morning. The colonel fell into the
       snare, and started immediately to surprise Vardarelli, whom
       he was assured was in a little village at the further
       extremity of a narrow pass, through which only four men
       could pass abreast. He made such haste that he marched four
       leagues in two hours, and at daybreak found himself at the
       entrance of the pass, which, however, seemed so peculiarly
       well adapted for an ambuscade, that he halted his battalion,
       and sent on twenty men to reconnoitre. In a quarter of an
       hour the twenty men returned. They had not met a single
       living thing. The colonel hesitated no longer, and entered
       the defile; but, on reaching a spot about halfway through
       it, where the road widened out into a sort of platform
       surrounded by high rocks and steep precipices, a shout was
       suddenly heard, proceeding apparently from the clouds, and
       the poor colonel looking up, saw the summits of the rocks
       covered with brigands, who levelled their rifles at him and
       his soldiers. Nevertheless, he began forming up his men as
       well as the nature of the ground would permit, when
       Vardarelli himself appeared upon a projecting crag. 'Down
       with your arms, or you are dead men!' he shouted in a voice
       of thunder. The bandits repeated his summons, and the echoes
       repeated their voices, so that the troops, who had not made
       the same vow as their colonel, and who thought themselves
       surrounded by greatly superior numbers, cried out for
       quarter, in spite of the entreaties and menaces of their
       unfortunate commander. Then Vardarelli, without leaving his
       position, ordered them to pile their arms, and march to two
       different places which he pointed out to them. They obeyed;
       and Vardarelli, leaving twenty of his men in their ambush,
       came down with the remainder, who immediately proceeded to
       render the Neapolitan muskets useless (for the moment at
       least) by the same process which Gulliver employed to
       extinguish the conflagration of the palace at Lilliput.</p>

    <p>"The news of this affair put the king in very bad humour for
    the first twenty-four hours; after which time, however, the
    love of a joke overcoming his anger, he laughed heartily, and
    told the story to every one he saw; and as there are always
    lots of listeners when a king narrates, three years elapsed
    before the poor colonel ventured to show his face at Naples and
    encounter the ridicule of the court."</p>

    <p>The general commanding in Calabria takes the matter rather
    more seriously, and vows the destruction of the banditti. By
    offers of large pay and privileges, they are induced to enter
    the Neapolitan service, and prove highly efficient as a troop
    of gendarmes. But the general cannot forget his old grudge
    against them; although, for lack of an opportunity, and on
    account of the desperate character of the men, he is obliged to
    defer his revenge for some time. At last he succeeds in having
    their leaders assassinated, and by pretending great
    indignation, and imprisoning the perpetrators of the deed, he
    lulls the suspicions of the remaining bandits, who elect new
    officers, and on an appointed day, proceed to the town of
    Foggia to have their election confirmed. Only eight of them,
    apprehensive of treachery, refuse to accompany their comrades.
    The remaining thirty-one, and a woman who would not leave her
    husband, obey the general's summons.</p>

    <p>"It was a Sunday, the review had been publicly announced,
    and the square was thronged with spectators. The Vardarelli
    entered the town in perfect order, armed to the very teeth, but
    giving no sign of hostility or mistrust. On reaching the
    square, they raised their sabres, and with one voice
    exclaimed&mdash;'<i>Viva il Re</i>!' The general appeared on
    his balcony to acknowledge their salute. The aide-de-camp on
    duty came down to receive them, and after complimenting them on
    the beauty of their horses and good state of their arms,
    desired them to file past under the general's window, which
    they did with a precision worthy of regular troops. They then
    formed up again in the middle of the square, and
    dismounted.</p>

    <p>"The aide-de-camp went into the house again with the list of
    the three <span class="pagenum"><a id="page360"
       name="page360"></a>[pg 360]</span> new officers; the
       Vardarelli were standing by their horses, when suddenly
       there was a great confusion and movement in the crowd, which
       opened in various places, and down every street leading to
       the square, a column of Neapolitan troops was seen
       advancing. The Vardarelli were surrounded on all sides.
       Perceiving at once that they were betrayed, they sprang upon
       their horses and drew their sabres; but at the same moment
       the general took off his hat, which was the signal agreed
       upon; the command, '<i>Faccia in terra</i>,' was heard, and
       the spectators, throwing themselves on their faces, the
       soldiers fired over them, and nine of the brigands fell to
       the ground, dead or mortally wounded. Those who were unhurt,
       seeing that they had no quarter to expect, dismounted, and
       forming a compact body, fought their way to an old castle in
       which they took refuge. Two only, trusting to the speed of
       their horses, charged the group of soldiers that appeared
       the least numerous, shot down two of them, and succeeded in
       breaking through the others and escaping. The woman owed her
       life to a similar piece of daring, effected, however, on
       another point of the enemy's line. She broke through, and
       galloped off, after having discharged both her pistols with
       fatal effect.</p>

    <p>"The attention of all was now turned to the remaining twenty
    Vardarelli, who had taken refuge in the ruined castle. The
    soldiers advanced against them, encouraging one another, and
    expecting to encounter an obstinate resistance; but, to their
    surprise, they reached the gate of the castle without a shot
    being fired at them. The gate was soon beaten in, and the
    soldiers spread themselves through the halls and galleries of
    the old building. But all was silence and solitude; the bandits
    had disappeared.</p>

    <p>"After an hour passed in rummaging every corner of the
    place, the assailants were going away in despair, convinced
    that their prey had escaped them; when a soldier, who was
    stooping down to look through the air-hole of a cellar, fell,
    shot through the body.</p>

    <p>"The Vardarelli were discovered; but still it was no easy
    matter to get at them. Instead of losing men by a direct
    attack, the soldiers blocked up the air-hole with stones, set a
    guard over it, and then going round to the door of the cellar,
    which was barricadoed on the inner side, they heaped lighted
    fagots and combustibles against it, so that the staircase was
    soon one immense furnace. After a time the door gave way, and
    the fire poured like a torrent into the retreat of the
    unfortunate bandits. Still a profound silence reigned in the
    vault. Presently two carbine shots were fired; two brothers,
    determined not to fall alive into the hands of their enemies,
    had shot each other to death. A moment afterwards an explosion
    was heard; a bandit had thrown himself into the flames, and his
    cartridge box had blown up. At last the remainder of the
    unfortunate men being nearly suffocated, and seeing that escape
    was impossible, surrendered at discretion, were dragged through
    the air-hole, and immediately bound hand and foot, and conveyed
    to prison.</p>

    <p>"As to the eight who had refused to come to Foggia, and the
    two who had escaped, they were hunted down like wild beasts,
    tracked from cavern to cavern, and from forest to forest. Some
    were shot, others betrayed by the peasantry, some gave
    themselves up, so that, before the year was out, all the
    Vardarelli were dead or prisoners. The woman who had displayed
    such masculine courage, was the only one who finally escaped.
    She was never heard of afterwards."</p>

    <p>M. Dumas finds that the climate of Naples, delightful as it
    is, has nevertheless its little drawbacks and disadvantages. He
    returns one night from an excursion in the environs, and has
    scarcely got into bed, when he is almost blown out of it again
    by a tornado of tropical violence.</p>

    <p>"At midnight, when we returned to Naples, the weather was
    perfect, the sky cloudless, the sea without a ripple. At three
    in the morning I was awakened by the windows of my room
    bursting open, their eighteen panes of glass falling upon the
    floor with a frightful clatter. I jumped out of bed, and felt
    that the house was shaking. I thought of Pliny the Elder, and
    having no desire for a similar fate, I hastily pulled on my
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361"
       name="page361"></a>[pg 361]</span> clothes and hurried out
       into the corridor. My first impulse had apparently been that
       of all the inmates of the hotel, who were all standing, more
       or less dressed, at the doors of their apartments; amongst
       others, Jadin, who made his appearance with a phosphorus box
       in his hand, and his dog Milord at his heels. 'What a
       terrible draught in the house!' said he to me. This same
       draught, as he called it, had just carried off the roof of
       the Prince of San Feodoro's palace, including the garrets
       and several servants who were sleeping in them.</p>

    <p>"My first thought had been of an eruption of Vesuvius, but
    there was no such luck for us; it was merely a hurricane. A
    hurricane at Naples, however, is rather different from the same
    thing in any other European country.</p>

    <p>"Out of the seventy windows of the hotel, three only had
    escaped damage. The ceilings of seven or eight rooms were rent
    across. There was a crack extending from top to bottom of the
    house. Eight shutters had been carried away, and the servants
    were running down the street after them, just as one runs after
    one's hat on a windy day. The broken glass was swept away; as
    for sending for glaziers to mend the windows, it was out of the
    question. At Naples nobody thinks of disturbing himself at
    three in the morning. Besides, even had new panes been put in,
    they would soon have shared the fate of the old ones. We were
    obliged, therefore, to manage as well as we could with the
    shutters. I was tolerably lucky, for I had only lost one of
    mine. I went to bed again, and tried to sleep; but a storm of
    thunder and lightning soon rendered that impossible, and I took
    refuge on the ground-floor, where the wind had done less
    damage. Then began one of those storms of which we have no idea
    in the more northern parts of Europe. It was accompanied by a
    deluge such as I had never witnessed, except perhaps in
    Calabria. In an instant the Villa Reale appeared to be a part
    of the sea; the water came up to the windows of the
    ground-floor, and flooded the parlours. A minute afterwards,
    the servants came to tell M. Zill that his cellars were full,
    and his casks of wine floating about and staving one another.
    Presently we saw a jackass laden with vegetables come swimming
    down the street, carried along by the current. He was swept
    away into a large open drain, and disappeared. The peasant who
    owned him, and who had also been carried away, only saved
    himself from a like fate by clinging to a lamp-post. In one
    hour there fell more water than there falls in Paris during the
    two wettest months in the year.</p>

    <p>"Two hours after the cessation of the rain, the water had
    disappeared, and I then perceived the use of this kind of
    deluge. The streets were clean; which they never are in Naples
    except after a flood of this sort."</p>

    <p>One short anecdote, and we have done. After a long account
    of St Januarius, including the well-known miracle of the
    liquefaction of his blood, and some amusing illustrations of
    his immense popularity with the Neapolitans, M. Dumas, in two
    pithy lines, gives us the length, breadth, and thickness of a
    lazzarone's religion.</p>

    <p>"I was one day in a church at Naples," he says, "and I heard
    a lazzarone praying aloud. He entreated God to intercede with
    St Januarius to make him win in the lottery."</p>

    <p>On the whole, we think this one of the most amusing of M.
    Dumas's works, very light and sketchy, as is evident from our
    extracts; but at the same time giving a great deal of
    information concerning Naples, its environs, inhabitants, and
    customs, of much interest, and calculated to be highly useful
    to the traveller. It is also very free from a fault with which
    we taxed its author in a former paper, and we can scarcely call
    to mind a single line which it would be necessary to expunge,
    in order to render it fit reading for the most fastidious. As
    far as we ourselves are concerned, we heartily wish M. Dumas
    would travel over all the kingdoms of the earth, and write a
    book about each of them; and if he is as good company in a
    post-chaise as his books are at the chimney-corner, there are
    few things we should like better than to accompany him on his
    pilgrimage.</p>

    <p>The market-place was lighted up, and filled with dragoons.
    Leaving my hulans under cover of a dark street, and riding
    forward to reconnoitre, I saw with astonishment the utter
    carelessness with which they abandoned themselves to their
    indulgences in the midst of an irritated population. Some were
    drinking on horseback; some had thrown themselves on the
    benches of the market, and were evidently intoxicated. The
    people stood at the corners of the streets looking on, palpably
    in terror, yet as palpably indignant at the outrage of the
    military. From the excessive blaze in some of the windows, and
    the shrieks of females, I could perceive that plunder was going
    on, and that the intention was, after having ransacked the
    place, to set it on fire. Yet a strong body of cavalry mounted
    in the middle of the square, and keeping guard round a waggon
    on which a guillotine had been already erected, still made me
    feel that an attack would be hopeless. I soon saw a rush of the
    people from one of the side streets; a couple of dragoon
    helmets were visible above the crowd; and three or four carts
    followed, filled with young females in white robes and flowers,
    as if dressed for a ball. I gazed intently, to ascertain the
    meaning of this strange and melancholy spectacle. At this
    moment I felt my horse's bridle pulled, and saw the old noble
    at his head. "Now or never!" he cried, in a voice almost choked
    with emotion. "Those are destined for the guillotine.
    Barbarians! brigands!&mdash;they will murder my Amalia." He
    sank before me. "What! is this an execution?" I exclaimed. His
    answer was scarcely above a whisper, for he seemed fainting.
    "The villains have been sent," said he, "to burn the town; they
    have seized those children of our best families, compelled them
    to dress as they were dressed for the Prussian ball, and are
    now about to murder them by their accursed guillotine."
    Pointing to one lovely girl, who, pale as death, stood in the
    foremost of those vehicles of death, he exclaimed "Amalia! O,
    my Amalia!" The cart was already within a few feet of the
    scaffold when I gave the word to my troopers. The brave fellows
    answered my "Forward!" with a shout, charged sabre in hand, and
    in an instant had thrown themselves between the victims and the
    scaffold. Their escort, taken completely by surprise, was
    broken at the first shock; we dashed without loss of time on
    the squadrons scattered round the market, and swept it clear of
    them. Surprised, intoxicated, and unacquainted with our
    force&mdash;which they probably thought to be the advance of
    the whole Prussian cavalry&mdash;after having lost many men,
    for the peasantry showed no mercy on the dismounted, the
    regiment turned at full gallop to the open country. The
    townspeople now performed their part. The victims were hurried
    away by their families, among a storm of lamentations and
    rejoicings, tears and kisses. The old noble's daughter, half
    dead, was carried off in her father's arms, with a thousand
    benedictions on me. The guillotine was hewn down with a hundred
    axes, and I saw the fragments burning in the square. Its waggon
    was made to serve its country as a portion of a barricade; and
    with every vehicle, wheeled or unwheeled, which could be rolled
    out, the entrance to the streets was fortified with the
    national rapidity in any deed, good or ill, under the
    stars.</p>

    <p>After having appeased our hunger <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page363"
       name="page363"></a>[pg 363]</span> and that of our famishing
       horses, and being offered all the purses, which the French
       dragoons, however, had lightened nearly to the last coin, we
       finished the exploit by a general chant in honour of the
       ladies, and marched on our route, followed by the prayers of
       the whole community. This ended the only productive skirmish
       of the retreat. It fed us, broke the monotony of the march,
       and gave us something to talk of&mdash;and the soldier asks
       but little more. A gallant action had certainly been done;
       not the less gallant for its being a humane one; and even my
       bold hulans gave me credit for being a "smart officer," a
       title of no slight value in their dashing service.</p>

    <p>Yet what, as the poet Saadi says, is fortune but a peacock
    "a showy tail on a frightful pair of legs?" Our triumph was to
    be followed by a reverse. The burgundy and champagne of the old
    count's cellar had made us festive, and our voices were heard
    along the road with a gaiety imprudent in a hostile land. The
    sound of a trumpet in our front brought us to our senses and a
    dead stand. But we were in a vein of heroism and instead of
    taking to our old hussar habits, and slipping round the enemy's
    flanks, we determined to cut our way through them, if they had
    the whole cavalry of France as their <i>appui</i>. The word was
    given, and the spur carried us through a strong line of cavalry
    posted across the road. The moon had just risen enough to show
    that there was a still stronger line a few hundred yards
    beyond, which it would be folly to touch. There was now no
    resource but to return as we went, which we did at full speed,
    and again broke up our antagonists. But again we saw squadron
    after squadron blocking up the road. All was now desperate. But
    Frederick's law of arms was well known&mdash;"the officer of
    cavalry who <i>waits to be charged</i>, must be broke." We made
    a plunge at our living circumvallation; but the French dragoons
    had now learned common sense&mdash;they opened for us&mdash;and
    when we were once fairly in, enveloped us completely; it was
    then a troop to a brigade; fifty jaded men and horses to
    fifteen hundred fresh from camp. What happened further I know
    not. I saw for a minute or two a great deal of pistol firing
    and a great deal of sabre clashing; I felt my horse stagger
    under me, at the moment when I aimed a blow at a gigantic
    fellow covered all over with helmet and mustache; a pistol
    exploded close at my ear as I was going down, and I heard no
    more.</p>

    <p>On opening my eyes again, I found the scene strangely
    altered. I was lying in a little chamber hung round with
    Parisian ornament&mdash;a sufficient contrast to a sky dark as
    pitch, or only illumined by carbines and the sparkles of sabres
    delving at each other. I was lying on an embroidered
    sofa&mdash;an equally strong contrast to my position under the
    bodies of fallen men and the heels of kicking horses. A showy
    Turkish cloak, or <i>robe de chambre</i>, had superseded my
    laced jacket, purple pantaloons, and hussar boots. I was
    completely altered as a warrior; and, from a glimpse which I
    cast on a mirror, surrounded with gilt nymphs and swains enough
    to have furnished a ballet, I saw in my haggard countenance,
    and a wound, which a riband but half concealed, across my
    forehead, that I was not less altered as a man.</p>

    <p>All round me looked so perfectly like the scenes with which
    I had been familiar in my romance-reading days, that, bruised
    and feeble as I was, I almost expected to find my pillow
    attended by some of those slight figures in long white drapery
    with blue eyes, which of old ministered to so many ill-used
    knights and exhausted pilgrims. But my reveries were broken up
    by a rough voice in the outer chamber insisting on an entrance
    into mine, and replied to by a weak and garrulous female one,
    refusing the admission. The dialogue was something of this
    order&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Strong or weak, well or ill, able or not able, I must send
    him, before twelve o'clock this night, to Paris."</p>

    <p>"But the poor gentleman's wounds are still unhealed."</p>

    <p>"Still he must set out. The '<i>malle poste</i>' will be at
    the door; and, if he had fifty wounds on him, he must go. The
    marquis is halfway to Paris by this time; perhaps more than
    halfway to the guillotine."</p>

    <p>This was followed by a burst of <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page364"
       name="page364"></a>[pg 364]</span> sobs and broken
       exclamtions from the female, whom I discovered, by her
       sorrowing confessions, to have been a nurse in the
       family.</p>

    <p>"Well," was the ruffian's reply; "women of all ages are
    fools: what is it to you whether this young fellow is shot or
    hanged? He was taken in arms against the Republic&mdash;one and
    indivisible. All the enemies of France must perish!"</p>

    <p>The old woman now partially opened the door, to see whether
    I slept; and I closed my eyes, for the purpose of hearing all
    that was to be heard without interruption. The speaker, whom I
    alternately took for the <i>gendarme</i> of the district, and
    the executioner, gave went to his swelling soul in the national
    style.</p>

    <p>"What! leave <i>me</i>! leave Jean Jacques Louis Gilet in
    charge of this wretched aristocrat, while I should be marching
    with my battalion, and at its head too, if merit meets its
    reward, to sweep the foes of the Republic from the face of the
    earth. No; I shall not remain in this paltry place, solicitor
    of a village, when I ought to be on the highest seat of
    justice&mdash;or playing the part of arresting aristocrats,
    when I might be commandant of a brigade, marching over the
    bodies of the crowned tyrants of the earth to glory!"</p>

    <p>As his harangue glowed, his pace quickened, and his voice
    grew more vehement; at length, probably impatient of the time
    which lay between him and the first offices of the Republic, he
    overpowered the resistance of the nurse, and rushed into the
    chamber. Throwng himself into a theatrical attitude before a
    mirror&mdash;for what Frenchman ever passes one without a
    glance of happy recognition?&mdash;"Rise, aristocrat!" he
    cried, in the tone of Talma calling up the shade of Caesar.
    "Rise, and account to the world for your crimes against the
    liberty of man!"</p>

    <p>I looked with such surprise on this champion of the sons of
    Adam&mdash;a little meagre creature, who seemed to be shaped on
    the model of one of his own pens, stripped, withered, and
    ink-dried&mdash;that I actually burst into laughter. His
    indignation rose, and, pulling out a pistol with one hand, and
    a roll of paper from his bosom with the other, he presented
    them together. I perceived, as I lay on my pillow, that the
    pistol was without a lock, and thus was comforted; but the
    paper was of a more formidable description. It was the famous
    decree of "Fraternization," by which France pronounced the fall
    of her own monarchy, declared "that she would grant succour to
    every people who wished to recover their liberty," and
    commanded her generals "to aid all such, and to defend all
    citizens who might be troubled in the cause of freedom."</p>

    <p>This paper indeed startled me; it was the consummation which
    I had dreaded so long. I saw at once that France, in those wild
    words, had declared war against every throne in Europe, and
    that we were now beginning the era of struggle and suffering
    which Mordecai's strong sense had predicted, and of which no
    human sagacity could foresee the end. My countenance probably
    showed the impression which this European anathema had made
    upon me; for Monsieur Gilet became more heroic than ever, tore
    his grizzled curls, throwing aside his pistol, which he had at
    length discovered to be <i>hors de combat</i>, and drawing the
    falchion which clattered at his heels, and was nearly as long
    as himself, flourished it in quick march backward and forward
    before the mirror&mdash;that mirror never forgotten!&mdash;in
    all the whirlwind of his rage, and panted for the conquest of
    "perfidious Albion," the "traitor" Pitt, and the whole brood of
    hoary power. I was too feeble to turn him out of the room, and
    too contemptuous to reply. But his overthrow was not the
    further off. The old nurse, who, old as she was, still retained
    some of the sinews and all the irritability of a stout
    Champenoise peasant, roused by his insults to the aristocracy,
    one of whom she probably regarded herself, from having lived so
    long under their roof, watched her opportunity, made a spring
    at him like a wild-cat, wrested the sabre from his hand, and,
    grasping the struggling and screaming little functionary in her
    strong arms, carried him like a child out of the room.</p>

    <p>She then returned, and having locked the door to prevent his
    second inroad, sat down by the side of my couch, and, with the
    usual passion of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page365"
       name="page365"></a>[pg 365]</span> women after strong
       excitement, burst into exclamations and tears. What I could
       collect from her broken narrative, was little more than the
       commonplace of national misery in that fearful time. She had
       been a servant in the family of the nobleman whose daughter
       I had saved from death. She had been the nurse of the young
       countess; and all the blessings that sorrow and gratitude
       ever gathered together, could not be exceeded by the praises
       which she poured upon my head. It had been rumoured in the
       town that I was attacked and killed by a body of cavalry
       sent to revenge the rout of their comrades. And the Marquis
       Lanfranc&mdash;I now first learned the name of my noble
       entertainer&mdash;had gone forth to look for my remains in
       the field. I was found still breathing, and to avoid further
       danger was carried to this dwelling, a hunting-lodge in the
       heart of the forest; there I had been attended by the family
       physician only, and, after a week of insensibility, had
       given signs of recovery. The marquis's humanity had brought
       evil on himself. His visits to the lodge had been remarked,
       and on this very morning he had been arrested, and conveyed
       with his daughter, in a carriage escorted by
       <i>gendarmes</i> to the capital. My detection followed of
       course; papers found on my person had proved that I was an
       agent of England; and the officious M. Gilet had spent the
       morning in exhibiting to the peasantry of the neighbourhood
       the order of the "Committee of Public Safety," a name which
       froze the blood, to take me under his charge, and conduct me
       forthwith to their tribunal. I tell all this in my own way;
       for the dame's sighs, sobs, and vehement indignation, would
       have defied all record.</p>

    <p>My prospect was now black enough, for justice was a word
    unheard of in the present condition of things; and my plea of
    being an Englishman, and in the civil service of my country,
    would have been a death-warrant. I must acknowledge, too, that
    I had fairly thrown it away by my adoption of the Prussian
    sabre. I might well be now in low spirits; for the guillotine
    was crushing out life at that moment in every province of
    France, and the thirst of public curiosity was to be fed by
    nothing but blood. Yet, even in that moment, let me give myself
    credit for the recollection, my first enquiry was for the fate
    of my squadron. The old woman could tell me but little on the
    subject; but that little was consolatory. The French troopers,
    who had come back triumphing into the town, had not brought any
    Prussian prisoners: two or three foreigners, who had lost their
    horses, were sheltered in her master's stables until they could
    make their escape; and of them she had heard no more. The truth
    is, that nothing is more difficult in war than to catch a
    hussar who understands his business; and the probability was,
    that the chief part of them had slipped away, leaving the
    French to sabre each other in the dark. The fall of my horse
    had brought me down, otherwise I might have escaped the shot
    which stunned me, and been at that hour galloping to
    Berlin.</p>

    <p>Monsieur Gilet, with some of the civic authorities, paid me
    a second visit in the evening, to prepare me for my journey. To
    me it was become indifferent whether I died in the carriage or
    by the edge of the guillotine; the journey was short in either
    case, and the shorter and sooner the better. I answered none of
    their interrogatories; told them I was at their disposal;
    directed the old woman to pack up whatever travelling matters
    remained to me, and to remember me to her master and mistress,
    if she ever should see them in this world; shook her strong old
    hand, and bade God bless her. In return, she kissed me on both
    cheeks, whispered a thousand benedictions, and left the room
    violently sobbing; yet with a parting glance at Monsieur Gilet
    and his <i>collaborateurs</i>, so mingled of wrath and
    ridicule, that it was beyond all my deciphering.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i2">"Time and the hour run through the
            longest day,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>says the great poet; and, with the coming of midnight, a
    <i>chaise de poste</i> drew up at the door. As I was a prisoner
    of importance, M. Gilet was not suffered to take all the honour
    of my introduction to the axe on himself; and the mayor and
    deputy-mayor of the district insisted on this
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page366"
       name="page366"></a>[pg 366]</span> opportunity of making
       themselves known to the supreme Republic. They mounted the
       box in front, a couple of gendarmes sat behind, M. Gilet
       took his seat at my side, and, with an infinite cracking of
       whips, we rushed out upon the causeway.</p>

    <p>I soon discovered that my companion was by no means
    satisfied with existing circumstances. The officiousness of the
    pair of mayors prodigiously displeased him. He broke
    forth&mdash;</p>

    <p>"See these two beggars," he exclaimed, "pretending to
    patriotism! They have no energy, no courage, no civism. Why,
    <i>you</i> might have remained for a twelvemonth under their
    very nostrils before they would have found you out. Gilet is
    the man for the service of his country." Merely to stop the
    torrent of his complainings, I asked him some vague questions
    relative to the nobleman whom I was now following to Paris. But
    the patriot was not to be moved from his topic.</p>

    <p>"Hah! Citizen Lanfranc. All is over with him. He once held
    his head high enough, but it will soon be as low as ever it was
    high. Yet I could have forgiven his aristocracy, if he had not
    put these two 'chiens' above me."</p>

    <p>The position in which the mayor and his deputy sat, on the
    box of the chaise, continually presenting them to the eye of my
    companion, kept his choler peculiarly active.</p>

    <p>"One of these fellows," he exclaimed, "was the Marquis's
    cook, another his perruquier! <i>I</i> was his tailor. Every
    man of taste and talent knows the superiority of <i>my</i>
    profession; for what is the first of noblemen without elegance
    of costume, or what indeed would man himself be without my art,
    the noblest and the earliest art of mankind? And yet he made
    these two 'brigands' mayor and deputy&mdash;<i>peste</i>! I did
    my duty. I denounced him on the spot. I did more. The
    aristocrat had a faction in the town. It was filled with his
    dependents. In fact, it had been built on his grounds, and
    tenanted by the old hangers-on of the family. So, to make a
    clear stage, I denounced the town." He clapped his hands with
    exultation at this civic triumph.</p>

    <p>My recollection of the miseries which his malice had caused
    roused me into wrath, and, rash as the act was, I grasped him
    by the collar, with the full intent of throwing the little
    writhing wretch out of the window; but, while I was lifting him
    from the seat to which he clung screaming for help, and had
    already forced him halfway outside, a shot whistled close by
    the head of the postilion, which brought him to a full stop.
    "Mon Dieu!&mdash;Brigands!" exclaimed Monsieur Gilet; and,
    dropping back into the carriage, attempted to make a screen of
    my body by slipping his adroitly behind me. Two or three more
    discharges rattled through the trees, followed by a rush of
    peasants, who unceremoniously knocked down the two officials in
    front, and began a general scuffle with the gendarmes. The
    night was so dark, that I could discover nothing of the
    <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> but by the blaze of the fusils. All,
    however, was quiet in a few moments, by the disappearance of
    the gendarmes, and the complete capture of the convoy&mdash;M.
    Gilet, mayors, and all. Whether we had fallen into the hands of
    highwaymen, or of stragglers from the French army, was doubtful
    for a while, as not a syllable was spoken, nor a sound uttered,
    except by the unhappy functionaries, who grumbled prodigiously
    as they were dragged along through "rough and smooth, moss and
    mire," and whose pace was evidently quickened by many a kick
    and blow of the fusil. This was a rude march for me, too, with
    my unhealed wound, and my week's sojourn in bed; but I was
    treated, if not with tenderness, without incivility, while my
    <i>compagnons de voyage</i> were insulted with every
    contemptuous phrase in a vocabulary at least as rich in those
    matters as any other in Europe. At length, after about an
    hour's rapid movement, we reached an open ground, and the door
    of one of the wide, old, staring, yet not uncomfortable
    farmhouses which are to be found in the northern provinces of
    France.</p>

    <p>Signs of comfort within were visible even at a distance, and
    the light of a huge wood fire had been seen for the last
    quarter of an hour gleaming through the woods, and leaving us
    in doubt whether we were approaching a horde of gipsies, or
    about to realize the classic scenes of Gil Blas.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page367"
       name="page367"></a>[pg 367]</span> But it was only a
       farm-house after all. The good dame of the house, with an
       enormous cap, enormous petticoats, enormous earrings, and
       all the glaring good-humour of a countenance of domestic
       plenty and power, came to meet us on the threshold; and her
       reception of me was ardent, to the very verge of
       stranglulation. Nothing could exceed her rapture at the
       sight of me, or the fierceness of her embraces, except her
       indignation at the sight of my traveling companions. Her
       disgust at the mayor and his deputy&mdash;and certainly
       after their night trip they were not figures to charm the
       eye&mdash;was pitched in the highest key of scorn, so as to
       be surpassed only by the torrent of contempt which her
       well-practised elocution poured upon the "<i>tra&icirc;tre
       tailleur.</i>" I really believe, that, if she could have
       boiled him in the huge soup-kettle which bubbled upon the
       fire, without spoiling our supper, she would have flung him
       in upon the spot. The peasants who had captured
       us&mdash;bold, tall fellows, well dressed and well armed
       with cutlass and fusil, in the style of the
       <i>gardes-de-chasse</i>&mdash;could scarcely be kept from
       taking them out to the next tree, to make marks of them; and
       it was probably by my intercession alone that they were
       consigned to an outer house for the night. How the scene was
       to end with me, I knew not; though the jovial visage of my
       protectress showed me that I was secure. But the prisoners
       had no sooner been flung out of the door than I was ushered
       into an inner room, prepared with somewhat more of
       attention; where, to my great surprise and delight, the
       Marquis Lanfranc came forward to shake my hand, and, with a
       thousand expressions of gratitude, made me known to his
       daughter. The adventure was of the simplest order. The
       arrest of the Marquis was, of course, known in an instant,
       and a party of his foresters had immediately determined to
       take the law into their own hands&mdash;had posted
       themselves on the road by which his carriage was to pass,
       and had released him without difficulty. My release was
       merely a sequel to the drama. I had been left in the
       hunting-lodge by its owner, under the impression that an
       individual who could not be moved without hazard to life,
       would escape the vengeance of village patriotism. But the
       nurse, whom he had placed in charge of me, had no sooner
       ascertained that I was arrested, than she sent an express to
       the farm-house. The consequence naturally followed in my
       liberty; and the night which I expected to have spent
       freezing on my way to the dungeon, presented me with the
       pleasant exchange of hospitable shelter, the society of a
       most accomplished man, and his graceful handsome daughter;
       and last, not least, a couple of kisses from my late nurse,
       according to the custom of the country, as glowing and
       remorseless as those of my portly landlady herself.</p>

    <p>We sat for some hours, and scarcely felt them pass in the
    anxious topics which engrossed us; the perils of France, the
    prospects of the Allies, and the captivity of the unhappy
    Bourbons. Now and then the conversation turned on their own
    hair-breadth escapes, and those of their relatives and friends.
    Among the rest, the hazards of the De Tourville family were
    mentioned, and I heard the name of Clotilde pronounced with a
    sensation indescribable. The name was connected with such
    displays of fortitude, nobleness of spirit, and deep devotion
    to the royal cause, that, if I had loved before, I now honoured
    her. She had saved the lives of her household; she had, by an
    act of extraordinary, but most perilous affection, saved the
    life of her mother, at the moment when the first insurgency
    broke out; and, young as she was, she had exhibited so noble a
    union of generosity and strength of mind, that the Marquis's
    eyes filled with tears as he told it, and Amalia buried her
    forehead in her hands to conceal her convulsive emotions: what
    must have been mine!</p>

    <p>Our conversation was not unfrequently interrupted by bursts
    of merriment from the outer room, where the peasants were at
    supper provided by the Marquis for his bold rescuers&mdash;an
    indulgence which they seemed to enjoy with the highest zest
    imaginable. Songs were sung with very various kinds of merit in
    the performer, but all well received. Healths were proposed, in
    which the existing Government was certainly not much honoured;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page368"
       name="page368"></a>[pg 368]</span> and, if the good wishes
       of the party could have sent the "Committee of Public
       Safety," the butcher cabinet of France, to the darkest spot
       on earth, or under it, its time would have been brief. But
       even this died away; the laugh subsided, the mirth grew
       silent, and at length the <i>gardes-de-chasse</i> went away,
       making the forest ring with their professional whoops and
       holloas, the remnants of their honest revel. At length the
       Marquis and his daughter, who were to be on the wing at
       daybreak for the German frontier, and who had generously
       offered to take charge of my invalid frame in the same
       direction, retired; and wrapping myself up in a dark cloak,
       furnished by my mistress and formed to her showy
       proportions, I threw myself on the sofa, and was in the land
       of dreams.</p>

    <p>But though I slept, I did not rest. My fever, or my
    lassitude, or probably some presentiment of the troubled career
    into which I was to be plunged, made "tired nature's sweet
    restorer" a stepmother to me. I can never endure hearing the
    dreams of others, and thus I cannot suffer myself to inflict
    them on my hearers; but on that night, Queen Mab, like Jehu,
    drove her horses furiously. Every possible kind of
    disappointment, vexation, and difficulty; every conceivable
    shape of things, past and present, rushed through my brain; and
    all pale, fierce, disastrous, and melancholy. I was beckoned
    along dim shades by shapeless phantoms; I was trampled in
    battle; I was brought before a tribunal; I was on board a ship
    which blew up, and was flung strangling down an infinite depth
    in a midnight ocean. But this exceeded the privilege even of
    dreams. I made one desperate effort to rise, and awoke with a
    bound on the floor. There I found a real obstacle&mdash;a
    ruffian in a red cap. One strong hand was on my throat; and by
    the glimmer of the dying lantern, which hung from the roof, I
    saw the glitter of a pistol-barrel in the other. "Surrender in
    the name of the Republic!" were the words which told me my
    fate. Four or five wearers of the same ominous emblem, with
    sabres and pistols, were round me at the moment, and after a
    brief struggle I was secured. Cries were now heard outside the
    door, and a wounded gendarme was carried in, borne in the arms
    of his comrades. From their confused clamour, I could merely
    ascertain that the gendarmes who had escaped in the original
    <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, had obtained assistance, and
    returned on their steps. The farm-house had been surrounded,
    and the Marquis was indebted only to the vigilance of his
    peasantry for a second escape with his daughter. The
    <i>gardes-de-chasse</i> had kept the gendarmes at bay until
    their retreat was secure; and the post-chaise which had brought
    M. Gilet and his coadjutors, was, by this time, some leagues
    off, at full speed, beyond the fangs of Republicanism.</p>

    <p>This at least was comfort, though I was left behind. But it
    was clear that the gallant old noble was blameless in the
    matter, and that nothing was to be blamed but my habitual ill
    luck. "<i>En route</i> for Paris," was the last order which I
    heard; and with a gendarme, in the strange kind of post-waggon
    which was rolled out from the farmer's stable, I was
    dispatched, before daybreak, on my startling journey.</p>

    <p>I found my gendarme a facetious fellow; though his merriment
    might not be well adapted to cheer his prisoner. He whistled,
    he sang, he screamed, he stamped, to get rid of the ennui of
    travelling with so silent a companion. He told stories of his
    own prowess; libeled M. Gilet, who had got him beaten on this
    service in the first instance, and who seemed to be in the
    worst possible odour with man and woman; and abused all,
    mayors, deputy-mayors, and authorities, with the tongue of a
    leveler. But my facetious friend had his especial
    <i>chagrins</i>.</p>

    <p>"I have all my life," said he, "been longing to see Paris,
    and have never been able to stir a step beyond this stupid
    province. Yet I have had my chances too. I was once valet to a
    German count, and we were on the way to Paris together when the
    post-chaise was stopped, the baron was arrested as a swindler,
    and I was charged as his accomplice. He was sent to the
    galleys; I got off. I then had a second chance. I enlisted in a
    regiment of dragoons which was to be <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page369"
       name="page369"></a>[pg 369]</span> quartered in Versailles.
       But such was my fate, I had no sooner passed the first
       drill, when we were ordered off to Lorraine to watch old
       King Stanislaus, the Pole, who lived there like one of his
       own bears, frozen and fat. Still I was determined to see
       Paris. I asked leave of absence; the adjutant laughed at me,
       the colonel turned on his heel, and the provost-marshal gave
       me a week of the black-hole. But a week is but seven days
       after all, and on my seeing the parade
       again&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"You deserted?"</p>

    <p>"Not quite that," was the reply. "I took leave, and, as I
    had seen enough of the black hole already, I took good care to
    give the provost-marshal no notice on the subject. A
    fortnight's march brought me within sight of the towers of
    Notre-Dame. But as I was resting myself on the roadside, our
    adjutant, as ill luck would have it, came by in the
    <i>coupe</i> of the diligence. He jumped out. I was seized,
    given up to the next guard-house, and after fitting me with a
    pair of fetters, by way of boots, I was ordered to take my
    passage with a condemned regiment for the West Indies. There I
    served ten years; I saw the regiment reduced to a skeleton by
    short rations and new rum; and returned the tenth
    representative of fifteen hundred felons. At last I have a
    chance; the gendarme of the village was so desperately mauled
    by the foresters in the attempt to carry you prisoner, that he
    has been forced to take to his bed, and let me take his place.
    The thing is certain now. <i>You</i> will be guillotined, but I
    shall see Paris."</p>

    <p>Yet what is certain in this most changeful of possible
    worlds?</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i6">"Fate granted half the prayer,</p>

            <p>The rest the gods dispersed in empty air."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>We had toiled through our long journey, rendered doubly long
    by the dreariest and deepest roads on earth, and were winding
    round the spur of Montmartre, when a troop of citizen heroes,
    coming forth to sweep the country of the retreating Prussians,
    and whose courage had risen to the boiling point by the news of
    the retreat, surrounded the carriage. My Prussian uniform was
    proof enough for the brains of the patriots; and the quick
    discovery of Parisian ears, that I had not learned my French in
    their capital, settled the question of my being a traitor. The
    gendarme joined in the charge with his natural volubility; but
    rather insisted rashly on his right to take his prisoner into
    Paris on his own behalf. I saw a cloud gathering on the brow of
    the <i>chef</i>, a short, stout, and grim-looking fellow, with
    the true Faubourg St Antoine physiognomy. The prize was
    evidently too valuable not to be turned to good account with
    the authorities; and he resolved on returning at the head of
    his brother patriots to present me as the first-fruits of his
    martial career. The dispute grew hot; my escort was foolish
    enough to clap his hand on the hilt of his sabre&mdash;an
    affront intolerable to a citizen, at the head of fifty or sixty
    <i>braves</i> from the counter or the shambles; the result was,
    a succession of blows from the whole troop, which closed in my
    seeing him stripped of every thing, and flung into the
    <i>cachot</i> of the <i>corps de garde</i>, from which his only
    view of his beloved Paris must have been through an iron
    <i>grille</i>.</p>

    <p>My captor, determined to enter the capital for once with
    eclat, seated himself beside me in the <i>chaise de poste</i>,
    and, surrounded by his pike-bearers, we began our march down
    the descent of the hill.</p>

    <p>My new friend was communicative. He gave his history in a
    breath. He had been a clerk in the office of one of the small
    tribunals in the south; inflamed with patriotism, and indignant
    at the idea of selling his talents at the rate of ten sous
    a-day, "in a rat-hole called a bureau," he had resolved on
    being known in the world, and to Paris he came. Paris was the
    true place for talent. His <i>civisme</i> had become
    conspicuous; he had "assisted" at the birth of liberty. He had
    carried a musket on the 10th of August, and had "been appointed
    by the Republic to the command of the civic force," which now
    moved, before and behind me. He was a "<i>grand homme</i>"
    already. Danton had told him so within the last fortnight, and
    France and Europe would no sooner <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page370"
       name="page370"></a>[pg 370]</span> read his last pamphlet on
       the "Crimes of Kings," than his fame would be fixed with
       posterity.</p>

    <p>I believe that few men have passed through life without
    experiencing times when it would cost them little to lay it
    down. At least such times have occurred to me, and this was
    among them. Yet this feeling, whether it is to be called
    nonchalance or despair, has its advantages for the moment; it
    renders the individual considerably careless of the worst that
    man can do to him; and I began to question my oratorical
    judge's clerk on the events in the "city of cities." No man
    could take fuller advantage of having a listener at his
    command.</p>

    <p>"We have cut down the throne," said he, clapping his hands
    with exultation, "and now you may buy it for firewood. But you
    are an aristocrat, and of course a slave; while we have got
    liberty, equality, and a triumvirate that shears off the heads
    of traitors at a sign. Suspicion of being suspected is quite
    sufficient. Away goes the culprit; a true patriot is ordered to
    take possession of his house until the national pleasure is
    known; and thus every thing goes on well. Of course, you have
    heard of the clearance of the prisons. A magnificent work. Five
    thousand aristocrats, rich, noble, and enemies to their
    country, sent headless to the shades of tyrants. <i>Vive la
    Republique</i>! But a grand idea strikes me. You shall see
    Danton himself, the genius of liberty, the hero of human
    nature, the terror of kings." The thought was new, and a new
    thought is enough to turn the brain of the Gaul at any time. He
    thrust his head out of the window, ordered a general halt; and,
    instead of taking me to the quarters of the National, resolved
    to have the merit of delivering up an "agent of Pitt and
    English guineas" to the master of the Republic alone. "<i>A
    l'Abbaye</i>!" was his cry. But a new obstacle now arose in his
    troop; they had reckoned on a civic supper with their comrades
    of the guard; and the notion of bivouacking in front of the
    Abbaye, under the chilling wind and fierce showers which now
    swept down the dismal streets, was too much for their sense of
    discipline. The dispute grew angry. At length one of them, a
    huge and savage-looking fellow, who, by way of illustration,
    thrust his pike close to the little commandant's shrinking
    visage, bellowed out&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The people are not to be insulted. The people order, and
    all must obey!" Nothing could be more unanswerable, and no
    attempt was made to answer. The captain dropped back into the
    chaise, the troop took their own way, and my next glance showed
    the street empty. But the Frenchman finds comfort under all
    calamities. After venting his wrath in no measured terms on
    "rabble insolence," and declaring that laws were of no use when
    "<i>gueux</i>" like these could take them into their hands, he
    consoled himself by observing that, stripped as he was of his
    honours, the loss might be compensated by his profits; that the
    "vagabonds" might have expected to share the reward which the
    "grand Danton would infallibly be rejoiced to give for my
    capture, and that both the purse and the praise would be his
    own." "<i>A l'Abbaye</i>!" was the cry once more.</p>

    <p>We now were in motion again; and, after threading a
    labyrinth of streets, so dreary and so dilapidated as almost to
    give me the conception that I had never been in Paris before,
    we drove up to the grim entrance of the Abbaye. My companion
    left me in charge of the sentinel, and rushed in. "And is
    this," thought I, as I looked round the narrow space of the
    four walls, "the spot where so many hundreds were butchered;
    this the scene of the first desperate triumph of massacre; this
    miserable court the last field of so many gallant lives; these
    stones the last resting-place of so many whose tread had been
    on cloth of gold; these old and crumbling walls giving the last
    echo to the voices of statesmen and nobles, the splendid
    courtiers, the brilliant orators, and the hoary ecclesiastics,
    of the most superb kingdom of Europe!" Even by the feeble
    lamp-light, that rather showed the darkness than the forms of
    the surrounding buildings, it seemed to me that I could
    discover the colour of the slaughter on the ground; and there
    were still heaps in corners, which looked to me like clay
    suddenly flung over the remnants of the murdered.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page371"
       name="page371"></a>[pg 371]</span> But my reveries were
       suddenly broken up by the return of the little captain, more
       angry than ever. He had missed the opportunity of seeing the
       "great man," who had gone to the Salpetri&egrave;re. And
       some of the small men who performed as his jackals, having
       discovered that the captain was looking for a share in their
       plunder, had thought proper to treat him, his commission,
       and even his civism, with extreme contempt. In short, as he
       avowed to me, the very first use which he was determined to
       make of that supreme power to which his ascent was
       inevitable, would be to clear the <i>bureaux</i> of France,
       beginning with Paris, of all those insolent and idle
       hangers-on, who lived only to purloin the profits, and libel
       the services, of "good citizens."</p>

    <p>"<i>A la Salpetri&egrave;re</i>." There again disappointment
    met us. The great man had been there "but a few minutes
    before," and we dragged our slow way through mire and ruts that
    would have been formidable to an artillery waggon with all its
    team. My heart, buoyant as it had been, sank within me as I
    looked up at the frowning battlements, the huge towers, more
    resembling those of a fortress than of even a prison, the
    gloomy gates, and the general grim aspect of the whole vast
    circumference, giving so emphatic a resemblance of the
    dreariness and the despair within.</p>

    <p>"<i>Aux Carmes</i>!" was now the direction; for my
    conductor's resolve to earn his reward before daybreak, was
    rendered more pungent by this interview with the <i>gens de
    bureau</i> at the Abbaye. He was sure that they would be
    instantly on the scent; and if they once took me out of his
    hands, adieu to dreams, of which Alnaschar, the glassman's,
    were only a type. He grew nervous with the thought, and poured
    out his whole vision of hopes and fears with a volubility which
    I should have set down for frenzy, if in any man but a wretch
    in the fever of a time when gold and blood were the universal
    and combined idolatries of the land.</p>

    <p>"You may think yourself fortunate," he exclaimed, "in having
    been in my charge! That brute of a country gendarme could have
    shown you nothing. Now, <i>I</i> know every jail in Paris. I
    have studied them. They form the true knowledge of a citizen.
    To crush tyrants, to extinguish nobles, to avenge the cause of
    reason on priests, and to raise the people to a knowledge of
    their rights&mdash;these are the triumphs of a patriot. Yet,
    what teacher is equal to the jail for them all? <i>Mais
    voil&agrave; les Carmes</i>!"</p>

    <p>I saw a low range of blank wall, beyond which rose an
    ancient tower.</p>

    <p>"Here," said he, "liberty had a splendid triumph. A hundred
    and fifty tonsured apostles of incivism here fell in one day
    beneath the two-handed sword of freedom. A cardinal, two
    archbishops, dignitaries, monks, hoary with prejudices,
    antiquated with abuses, extinguishers of the new light of
    liberty, here were offered on the national shrine! <i>Chantons
    la Carmagnole</i>."</p>

    <p>But he was destined to be disappointed once more. Danton had
    been there, but was suddenly called away by a messenger from
    the Jacobins. Our direction was now changed again. "Now we
    shall be disappointed no longer. Once engaged in debate, he
    will be fixed for the night. <i>Allons</i>, you shall see the
    'grand patriote,' 'the regenerator,' 'the first man in the
    world.' <i>Aux Jacobins</i>!"</p>

    <p>Our unfortunate postilion falling with fatigue on his
    horses' neck, attempted to propose going to an inn, and
    renewing our search in the morning; but the captain had made up
    his mind for the night, and, drawing a pistol from his breast,
    exhibited this significant sign pointed at his head. The
    horses, as tired as their driver, were lashed on. I had for
    some time been considering, as we passed through the deserted
    streets, whether it was altogether consistent with the feelings
    of my country, to suffer myself to be dragged round the capital
    at the mercy of this lover of lucre; but an apathy had come
    over my whole frame, which made me contemptuous of life. The
    sight of his pistol rather excited me to make the attempt, from
    the very insolence of his carrying it. But we still rolled on.
    At length, in one of the streets, which seemed darker and more
    miserable than all the rest, we were brought to a full stop by
    the march of a strong body of the National Guard, which halted
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page372"
       name="page372"></a>[pg 372]</span> in front of an enormous
       old building, furnished with battlement and bartizan. "<i>Le
       Temple</i>!" exclaimed my companion, with almost a shriek of
       exultation. I glanced upward, and saw a light with the pale
       glimmer which, in my boyish days, I had heard always
       attributed to spectres passing along the dim casements of a
       gallery. I cannot express how deeply this image sank upon
       me. I saw there only a huge tomb&mdash;the tomb of living
       royalty, of a line of monarchs, of all the feelings that
       still bound the heart of man to the cause of France. All now
       spectral. But, whatever might be the work of my imagination,
       there was terrible truth; enough before me to depress, and
       sting, and wring the mind. Within a step of the spot where I
       sat, were the noblest and the most unhappy beings in
       existence&mdash;the whole family of the throne caught in the
       snare of treason. Father, mother, sister, children! Not one
       rescued, not one safe, to relieve the wretchedness of their
       ruin by the hope that there was an individual of their
       circle beyond their prison bars&mdash;all consigned to the
       grave together&mdash;all alike conscious that every day
       which sent its light through their melancholy casements,
       only brought them nearer to a death of misery! But I must
       say no more of this. My heart withered within me as I looked
       at the towers of the Temple. It almost withers within me, at
       this moment, when I think of them. They are leveled long
       since; but while I write I see them before me again, a
       sepulchre; I see the mustering of that crowd of more than
       savages before the grim gate; and I see the pale glimmer of
       that floating lamp, which was then, perhaps, lighting the
       steps of Marie Antoinette to her solitary cell.</p>

    <p>Of all the sights of that melancholy traverse, this the most
    disheartened me, whatever had been my carelessness of life
    before. It was now almost scorn. The thoughts fell heavy on my
    mind. What was I, when such victims were prepared for
    sacrifice? What was the crush of my obscure hopes, when the
    sitters on thrones were thus leveled with the earth? If I
    perished in the next moment, no chasm would be left in society;
    perhaps but one or two human beings, if even they, would give a
    recollection to my grave. But here the objects of national
    homage and gallant loyalty, beings whose rising radiance had
    filled the eye of nations, and whose sudden fall was felt as an
    eclipse of European light, were exposed to the deepest
    sufferings of the captive. What, then, was I, that I should
    murmur; or, still more, that I should resist; or, most of all,
    that I should desire to protract an existence which, to this
    hour, had been one of a vexed spirit, and which, to the last
    hour of my career, looked but cloud on cloud?</p>

    <p>Some of this depression may have been the physical result of
    fatigue, for I had been now four-and-twenty hours without rest;
    and the dismal streets, the dashing rain, and the utter absence
    of human movement as we dragged our dreary way along, would
    have made even the floor of a dungeon welcome. I was as cold as
    its stone.</p>

    <p>At length our postilion, after nearly relieving us of all
    the troubles of this world, by running on the verge of the moat
    which once surrounded the Bastile, and where nothing but the
    screams of my companion prevented him from plunging in, wholly
    lost his way. The few lamps in this intricate and miserable
    quarter of the city had been blown out by the tempest, and our
    only resource appeared to be patience, until the tardy break of
    winter's morn should guide us through the labyrinth of the
    Faubourg St Antoine. However, this my companion's patriotism
    would not suffer. "The Club would be adjourned! Danton would be
    gone!" In short, he should not hear the Jacobin lion roar, nor
    have the reward on which he reckoned for flinging me into his
    jaws. The postilion was again ordered to move, and the turn of
    a street showing a light at a distance, he lashed his
    unfortunate horses towards it. Utterly indifferent as to where
    I was to be deposited, I saw and heard nothing, until I was
    roused by the postilion's cry of "Place de Gr&egrave;ve."</p>

    <p>A large fire was burning in the midst of the gloomy square,
    round which a party of the National Guard were standing, with
    their muskets piled, and wrapped in their cloaks, against the
    inclemency of the night. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page373"
       name="page373"></a>[pg 373]</span> Further off, and in the
       centre, feebly seen by the low blaze, was a wooden
       structure, on whose corners torches were flaring in the
       wind. "<i>Voil&agrave;, la guillotine</i>!" exclaimed my
       captor with the sort of ecstasy which might issue from the
       lips of a worshipper. As I raised my eyes, an accidental
       flash of the fire showed the whole outline of the horrid
       machine. I saw the glitter of the very axe that was to drop
       upon my head. My first sensation was that of deadly
       faintless. Ghastly as was the purpose of that axe, my
       imagination saw even new ghastliness in the shape of its
       huge awkward scythe-like steel; it seemed made for massacre.
       The faintness went off in the next moment, and I was another
       man. In the whole course of a life of excitement, I have
       never experienced so total a change. All my apathy was gone.
       The horrors of public execution stood in a visible shape
       before me at once. I might have fallen in the field with
       fortitude; I might have submitted to the deathbed, as the
       course of nature; I might have even died with exultation in
       some great public cause. But to perish by the frightful
       thing which shot up its spectral height before me; to be
       dragged as a spectacle to scoffing and scorning
       crowds&mdash;dragged, perhaps, in the feebleness and squalid
       helplessness of a confinement which might have exhibited me
       to the world in imbecility or cowardice; to be grasped by
       the ruffian executioner, and flung, stigmatized as a felon,
       into the common grave of felons&mdash;the thought darted
       through my mind like a jet of fire; but it gave me the
       strength of fire. I determined to die by the bayonets of the
       guard, or by any other death than this. My captor perceived
       my agitation, and my eye glanced on his withered and
       malignant visage, as with a smile he was cocking his pistol.
       I sprang on him like a tiger. In our struggle the pistol
       went off, and a gush of blood from his cheek showed that it
       had inflicted a severe wound. I was now his master, and,
       grasping him by the throat with one hand, with the other I
       threw open the door and leaped upon the pavement. For the
       moment, I looked round bewildered; but the report of the
       pistol had caught the ears of the guard, whom I saw hurrying
       to unpile their muskets. But this was a work of confusion,
       and, before they could snatch up their arms, I had made my
       choice of the darkest and narrowest of the wretched lanes
       which issue into the square. A shot or two fired after me
       sent me at my full speed, and I darted forward, leaving them
       as they might, to follow.</p>

    <p>How long I scrambled, or how often I felt sinking from mere
    weariness in that flight, I knew not. In the fever of my mind,
    I only knew that I twined my way through numberless streets,
    most of which have been since swept away; but, on turning the
    corner of a street which led into the Boulevard, and when I had
    some hope of taking refuge in my old hotel, I found that I had
    plunged into the heart of a considerable crowd of persons
    hurrying along, apparently on some business which strongly
    excited them. Some carried lanterns, some pikes, and there was
    a general appearance of more than republican enthusiasm, even
    savage ferocity, among them, that gave sufficient evidence of
    my having fallen into no good company. I attempted to draw
    back, but this would not be permitted; the words, "Spy,
    traitor, slave of the Monarchiques!" and, apparently as the
    blackest charge of all, "Cordelier!" were heaped upon me, and I
    ran the closest possible chance of being put to death on the
    spot. It may naturally be supposed that I made all kinds of
    protestations to escape being piked or pistoled. But they had
    no time to wait for apologies. The cry of "Death to the
    traitor!" was followed by the brandishing of half a dozen
    knives in the circle round me. At that moment, when I must have
    fallen helplessly, a figure stepped forward, and opening the
    slide of his dark lantern directly on his own face, whispered
    the word Mordecai. I recognised, I shall not say with what
    feelings, the police agent who had formerly conveyed me out of
    the city. He was dressed, like the majority of the crowd, in
    the republican costume; and certainly there never was a more
    extraordinary costume. He wore a red cap, like the cap of the
    butchers of the Faubourgs; an enormous beard covered his
    breast, a short Spanish mantle hung from his shoulders, a short
    leathern doublet, with a belt <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page374"
       name="page374"></a>[pg 374]</span> like an armoury, stuck
       with knives and pistols, a sabre, and huge trousers striped
       with red, in imitation of streams of gore, completed the
       patriot uniform. Some wore broad bands of linen round their
       waists, inscribed, "2d, 3d and 4th September,"&mdash;the
       days of massacre. These were its heros. I was in the midst
       of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of murder.</p>

    <p>"Citizens," exclaimed the Jew in a voice of thunder, driving
    back the foremost, "hold your hands up; are you about to
    destroy a friend of freedom? Your knives have drunk the blood
    of aristocrats; but they are the defence of liberty. This
    citizen, against whom they are now unsheathed, is one of
    ourselves. He has returned from the frontier, to join the brave
    men of Paris, in their march to the downfall of tyrants. But
    out friends await us in the glorious club of the Jacobins. This
    is the hour of victory. Advance, regenerated sons of freedom!
    Forward, Frenchmen!"</p>

    <p>His speech had the effect. The rapid executors of public
    vengeance fell back; and the Jew, whispering to me, "You must
    follow us, or be killed,"&mdash;I chose the easier alternative
    at once, and stepped forward like a good citizen. As my
    protector pushed the crowd before him, in which he seemed to be
    a leader, he said to me from time to time, "Show no resistance.
    A word from you would be the signal for your death&mdash;we are
    going to the hall of the Jacobins. This is a great night among
    them, and the heads of the party will either be ruined
    to-night, or by morning will be masters of every thing. I
    pledge myself, if not for your safety, at least for doing all
    that I can to save you." I remained silent, as I was ordered;
    and we hurried on, until there was a halt in front of a huge
    old building. "The hall of the Jacobins," whispered the Jew,
    and again cautioned me against saying or doing any thing in the
    shape of reluctance.</p>

    <p>We now plunged into the darkness of a vast pile, evidently
    once a convent, and where the chill of the massive walls struck
    to the marrow. I felt as if walking through a charnel-house. We
    hurried on; a trembling light, towards the end of an immense
    and lofty aisle, was our guide; and the crowd, long familiar
    with the way, rushed through the intricacies where so many feet
    of monks had trod before them, and where, perhaps, many a deed
    that shunned the day had been perpetrated. At length a spiral
    stair brought us to a large gallery, where our entrance was
    marked with a shout of congratulation; and tumbling over the
    benches and each other, we at length took our seats in the
    highest part, which, in both the club and the National
    Assembly, was called, from its height, the Mountain, and from
    the characters which generally held it, was a mountain of
    flame. In the area below, once the nave of the church, sat the
    Jacobin club. I now, for the first time, saw that memorable and
    terrible assemblage. And nothing could be more suited than its
    aspect to its deeds. The hall was of such extent that a large
    portion of it was scarcely visible, and few lights which hung
    from the walls scarcely displayed even the remainder. The
    French love of decoration had no place here; neither statues
    nor pictures, neither gilding nor sculpture, relieved the
    heaviness of the building. Nothing of the arts was visible but
    their rudest specimens; the grim effigies of monks and martyrs,
    or the coarse and blackened carvings of a barbarous age. The
    hall was full; for the club contained nearly two thousand
    members, and on this night all were present. Yet, except for
    the occasional cries of approval or anger when any speaker had
    concluded, and the habitual murmur of every huge assembly, they
    might have been taken for a host of spectres; the area had so
    entirely the aspect of a huge vault, the air felt so thick, and
    the gloom was so feebly dispersed by the chandeliers. All was
    sepulchral. The chair of the president even stood on a tomb, an
    antique structure of black marble. The elevated stand, from
    which the speakers generally addressed the assembly, had the
    strongest resemblance to a scaffold, and behind it, covering
    the wall, were suspended chains, and instruments of torture of
    every horrid kind, used in the dungeons of old times; and
    though placed there for the sake of contrast with the mercies
    of a more enlightened age, yet <span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "page375"
       name="page375"></a>[pg 375]</span> enhancing the general
       idea of a scene of death. It required no addition to render
       the hall of the Jacobins fearful; but the meetings were
       always held at night, often prolonged through the whole
       night. Always stormy, and often sanguinary, daggers were
       drawn and pistols fired&mdash;assassination in the streets
       sometimes followed bitter attacks on the benches; and at
       this period, the mutual wrath and terror of the factions had
       risen to such height, that every meeting might be only a
       prelude to exile or the axe; and the deliberation of this
       especial night must settle the question, whether the
       Monarchy or the Jacobin club was to ascend the scaffold. It
       was the debate on the execution of the unhappy Louis
       XVI.</p>

    <p>The arrival of the crowd, among whom I had taken my
    unwilling seat, evidently gave new spirits to the regicides;
    the moment was critical. Even in Jacobinism all were not
    equally black, and the fear of the national revulsion at so
    desperate a deed startled many, who might not have been
    withheld by feelings of humanity. The leaders had held a secret
    consultation while the debate was drawing on its slow length,
    and Danton's old expedient of "terror" was resolved on. His
    emissaries had been sent round Paris to summon all his
    banditti; and the low <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, the Faubourg
    taverns, and every haunt of violence, and the very drunkenness
    of crime, had poured forth. The remnant of the
    Marseillois&mdash;a gang of actual galley-slaves, who had led
    the late massacres&mdash;the paid assassins of the Marais, and
    the <i>sabreurs</i> of the Royal Guard, who after treason to
    their king, had found profitable trade in living on the robbery
    and blood of the nobles and priests, formed this reinforcement;
    and their entrance into the gallery was recognised by a
    clapping of hands from below, which they answered by a roar,
    accompanied with the significant sign of clashing their knives
    and sabres.</p>

    <p>Danton immediately rushed into the Tribune. I had seen him
    before, on the fearful night which prepared the attack on the
    palace; but he was then in the haste and affected savageness of
    the rabble. He now played the part of leader of a political
    sect; and the commencement of his address adopted something of
    the decorum of public council. In this there was an artifice;
    for, resistless as the club was, it still retained a jealousy
    of the superior legislative rank of the assembly of national
    representatives, the Convention. The forms of the Convention
    were strictly imitated; and even those Jacobins who usually led
    the debate, scrupulously wore the dress of the better orders.
    Robespierre was elaborately dressed whenever he appeared in the
    Tribune, and even Danton abandoned the <i>canaille</i> costume
    for the time. I was struck with his showy stature, his bold
    forehead, and his commanding attitude, as he stood waving his
    hand over the multitude below, as if he waved a sceptre. His
    appearance was received with a general shout from the gallery,
    which he returned by one profound bow, and then stood erect,
    till all sounds had sunk. His powerful voice then rang through
    the extent of the hall. He began with congratulating the people
    on their having relieved the Republic from its external
    dangers. His language at first was moderate, and his
    recapitulation of the perils which must have befallen a
    conquered country, was sufficiently true and even touching; but
    his tone soon changed, and I saw the true democrat. "What!" he
    cried, "are those perils to the horrors of domestic perfidy?
    What are the ravages on the frontier to poison and the dagger
    at our firesides? What is the gallant death in the field to
    assassination in cold blood? Listen, fellow-citizens, there is
    at this hour a plot deeper laid for your destruction than ever
    existed in the shallow heads of, or could ever be executed by
    the coward hearts of, their soldiery. Where is that plot? In
    the streets? No. The courage of our brave patriots is as proof
    against corruption as against fear." This was followed by a
    shout from the gallery. "Is it in the Tuileries? No; there the
    national sabre has cut down the tree which cast its deadly
    fruits among the nation. Where then is the focus of the
    plot&mdash;where the gathering of the storm that is to shake
    the battlements of the Republic&mdash;where that terrible
    deposit of combustibles which the noble <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page376"
       name="page376"></a>[pg 376]</span> has gathered, the priest
       has piled, and the king has prepared to kindle? Brave
       citizens, that spot is &mdash;&mdash;," he paused, looking
       mysteriously round, while a silence deep as death pervaded
       the multitude; then, as if suddenly recovering himself, he
       thundered out&mdash;"The Temple!" No language can describe
       the shout or the scene that followed. The daring word was
       now spoken which all anticipated; but which Danton alone had
       the desperate audacity to utter. The gallery screamed,
       howled, roared, embraced each other, danced, flourished
       their weapons, and sang the Marseillaise and the Carmagnole.
       The club below were scarcely less violent in their
       demonstrations of furious joy. Danton had now accomplished
       his task; but his vanity thirsted for additional applause,
       and he entered into a catalogue of his services to
       Republicanism. In the midst of the detail, a low but
       singularly clear voice was heard, from the extremity of the
       hall.</p>

    <p>"Descend, man of massacre!"</p>

    <p>I saw Danton start back as if he had been shot. At length,
    recovering his breath, he said feebly&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Citizens, of what am I accused?"</p>

    <p>"Of the three days of September," uttered the voice again,
    in a tone so strongly sepulchral, that it palpably awed the
    whole assemblage.</p>

    <p>"Who is it that insults me? who dares to malign me? What spy
    of the Girondists, what traitor of the Bourbons, what hireling
    of the gold of Pitt, is among us?" exclaimed the bold ruffian,
    yet with a visage which, even at the distance, I could observe
    had lost its usual fiery hue, and turned clay-colour. "Who
    accuses me?"</p>

    <p>"I!" replied the voice, and I saw a thin tall figure stalk
    up the length of the hall, and stand at the foot of the
    tribune. "Descend!" was the only word which he spoke; and
    Danton, as if under a spell, to my astonishment, obeyed without
    a word, and came down. The stranger took his place, none knew
    his name; and the rapidity and boldness of his assault
    suspended all in wonder like my own. I can give but a most
    incomplete conception of the extraordinary eloquence of this
    mysterious intruder. He openly charged Danton with having
    constructed the whole conspiracy against the unfortunate
    prisoners of September; with having deceived the people by
    imaginary alarms of the approach of the enemy; with having
    plundered the national treasury to pay the assassins; and, last
    and most deadly charge of all, with having formed a plan for a
    National Dictatorship, of which he himself was to be the first
    possessor. The charge was sufficiently probable, and was not
    now heard for the first time. But the keenness and fiery
    promptitude with which the speaker poured the charge upon him,
    gave it a new aspect; and I could see in the changing
    physiognomies round me, that the great democrat was already in
    danger. He obviously felt this himself; for starting up from
    the bench to which he had returned, he cried out, or rather
    yelled&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Citizens, this man thirsts for my blood. Am I to be
    sacrificed? Am I to be exposed to the daggers of assassins!"
    But no answering shout now arose; a dead silence reigned: all
    eyes were still turned on the tribune. I saw Danton, after a
    gaze of total helplessness on all sides, throw up his hands
    like a drowning man, and stagger back to his seat. Nothing
    could be more unfortunate than his interruption; for the
    speaker now poured the renewed invective, like a stream of
    molten iron, full on his personal character and career.</p>

    <p>"Born a beggar, your only hope of bread was crime. Adopting
    the profession of an advocate, your only conception of law was
    chicanery. Coming to Paris, you took up patriotism as a trade,
    and turned the trade into an imposture. Trained to dependence,
    you always hung on some one till he spurned you. You licked the
    dust before Mirabeau; you betrayed him, and he trampled on you;
    you took refuge in the cavern of Marat, until he found you too
    base even for his base companionship, and he, too, spurned you;
    you then clung to the skirts of Robespierre, and clung only to
    ruin. Viper! known only by your coils and your poison; like the
    original serpent, degraded even from the brute into the
    reptile, you already feel your sentence. I pronounce it before
    all. The man to whom you now cling will crush you. Maximilien
    Robespierre, is not your heel already <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page377"
       name="page377"></a>[pg 377]</span> lifted up to tread out
       the life of this traitor? Maximilien Robespierre," he
       repeated with a still more piercing sound, "do I not speak
       the truth?" "Have I not stripped the veil from your
       thoughts? Am I not looking on your heart?" He then addressed
       each of the Jacobin leaders in a brief appeal. "Billaud
       Varennes, stand forth&mdash;do you not long to drive your
       dagger into the bosom of this new tyrant? Collot d'Herbois,
       are you not sworn to destroy him? Couthon, have you not
       pronounced him perjured, perfidious, and unfit to live? St
       Just, have you not in your bosom the list of those who have
       pledged themselves that Danton shall never be Dictator; that
       his grave shall be dug before he shall tread on the first
       step of the throne; that his ashes shall be scattered to the
       four winds of heaven; that he shall never gorge on
       France?"</p>

    <p>A hollow murmur, like an echo of the vaults beneath,
    repeated the concluding words. The murmur had scarcely subsided
    when this extraordinary apparition, flinging round him a long
    white cloak, which he had hitherto carried on his arm, and
    which, in the dim light, gave him the look of one covered with
    a shroud, cried out in a voice of still deeper solemnity,
    "George Jacques Danton, you have this night pronounced the
    death of your king&mdash;I now pronounce your own. By the
    victims of the 20th of June&mdash;by the victims of the 10th of
    August&mdash;by the victims of the 2d of September&mdash;by the
    thousands whom your thirst of blood has slain&mdash;by the tens
    of thousands whom your treachery has sent to perish in a
    foreign grave&mdash;by the millions whom the war which you have
    kindled will lay in the field of slaughter&mdash;I cite you to
    appear before a tribunal, where sits a judge whom none can
    elude and none can defy. Within a year and a month, I cite you
    to meet the spirits of your victims before the throne of the
    Eternal."</p>

    <p>He stopped; not a voice was heard. He descended the steps of
    the Tribune, and stalked slowly through the hall; not a hand
    was raised against him. He pursued his way with as much
    calmness and security as if he had been a supernatural
    visitant, until he vanished in the darkness.</p>

    <p>This singular occurrence threw a complete damp on the
    regicidal ardour; and, as no one seemed inclined to mount the
    Tribune, the club would probably have broken up for the night,
    when a loud knocking at one of the gates, and the beating of
    drums, aroused the drowsy sitters on the benches. The gallery
    was as much awake as ever; but seemed occupied with evident
    expectation of either a new revolt, or a spectacle; pistols
    were taken out to be new primed, and the points and edges of
    knives duly examined. The doors at length were thrown open, and
    a crowd, one half of whom appeared to be in the last stage of
    intoxication, and the other half not far from insanity, came
    dancing and chorusing into the body of the building. In the
    midst of their troop they carried two busts covered with
    laurels&mdash;the busts of the regicides Ravaillac and Clement,
    with flags before them, inscribed, "They were glorious; for
    they slew kings!" The busts were presented to the president,
    and their bearers, a pair of <i>poissardes</i>, insisted on
    giving him the republican embrace, in sign of fraternization.
    The president, in return, invited them to the "honours of a
    sitting;" and thus reinforced, the discussion on the death of
    the unhappy monarch commenced once more, and the vote was
    carried by acclamation. The National Convention was still to be
    applied to for the completion of the sentence; but the decree
    of the Jacobins was the law of the land.</p>

    <p>I had often looked towards the gallery door, during the
    night, for the means of escape; but my police friend had
    forbade my moving before his return. I therefore remained until
    the club were breaking up, and the gallery began to clear.
    Cautious as I had been, I could not help exhibiting, from time
    to time, some disturbance at the atrocities of the night, and
    especially at the condemnation of the helpless king. In all
    this I had found a sympathizing neighbour, who had exhibited
    marked civility in explaining the peculiarities of the place,
    and giving me brief sketches of the speakers as they rose in
    succession. He had especially agreed with me in deprecating the
    cruelty of the regicidal sentence. I now rose to bid my
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page378"
       name="page378"></a>[pg 378]</span> gentlemanlike
       <i>cicerone</i> good-night; but, to my surprise, I saw him
       make a sign to two loiterers near the door, who instantly
       pinioned me.</p>

    <p>"We cannot part quite so soon, Monsieur l'Aristocrat," said
    he; "and, though I much regret that I cannot have the honour of
    accommodating you in the Temple, near your friend Monsieur
    Louis Capet, yet you may rely on my services in procuring a
    lodging for you in one of the most agreeable prisons in
    Paris."</p>

    <p>I had been entrapped in the most established style, and I
    had nothing to thank for it but fortune. Resistance was in
    vain, for they pointed to the pistols within their coats; and
    with a vexed heart, and making many an angry remark on the
    treachery of the villain who had ensnared me&mdash;matters
    which fell on his ear probably with about the same effect as
    water on the pavement at my feet&mdash;I was put into a close
    carriage, and, with ny captors, carried off to the nearest
    barrier, and consigned to the governor of the well-known and
    hideous St Lazare.</p>

    <h2>FREE TRADE AND PROTECTION</h2>

    <h3>THE CORN LAWS.</h3>

    <p>It is remarkable that, while we hear so much of the
    advantages of free trade, the reciprocity of them is always in
    <i>prospect</i> only. By throwing open our harbours to foreign
    nations, indeed, we give <i>them</i> an immediate and obvious
    advantage over ourselves; but as to any corresponding
    advantages we are to gain in our intercourse with them, we are
    still waiting, in patient expectation of the anticipated
    benefit. Our patience is truly exemplary; it might furnish a
    model to Job himself. We resent nothing. No sooner do we
    receive a blow on one cheek, than we turn up the other to some
    new smiter. No sooner are we excluded, in return for our
    concessions, from the harbours of one state, than we begin
    making concessions to another. We are constantly in expectation
    of seeing the stream of human envy and jealousy run
    out:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis: at ille</p>

            <p>Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>We are imitating the man who made the experiment of
    constantly reducing the food on which his horse is to live. Let
    us take care that, just as he is learning to live on nothing,
    we do not find him dead in his stall.</p>

    <p>This, however, is no joking matter. The total failure of the
    free trade system to procure any, <i>even the smallest
    return</i>, coupled with the very serious injury it has
    inflicted on many of the staple branches of our industry, has
    now been completely demonstrated by experience, and is matter
    of universal notoriety. If any proof on the subject were
    required, it would be furnished by <i>Porter's Parliamentary
    Tables</i>, to which we earnestly request the attention of our
    readers. The first exhibits the effect of the reciprocity
    system, introduced by Mr Huskisson in Feb. 1823, in destroying
    our shipping with the Baltic powers, and quadrupling theirs
    with us. The second shows the trifling amount of our exports to
    these countries during the five last years, and thereby
    demonstrates the entire failure of the attempt to, extend our
    traffic with them by this gratuitous destruction of our
    shipping. The third shows the progress of our whole exports to
    Europe during the six years from 1814 to 1820, before the free
    trade began, and from 1833 to 1839, after it had been fifteen
    years in operation, and proves that it had <i>declined</i> in
    the latter period as compared with the former, despite all our
    gratuitous sacrifices by free trade to augment our
    commerce.<a id="footnotetag12"
       name="footnotetag12"></a><a href=
       "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

    <p>The free traders fully admit, and deeply deplore, as we have
    shown on a former occasion, these unfavourable results; but
    they say that it is to be hoped they will not continue: that
    foreign nations must, in the end, come to see that they are as
    much interested as we are in enlightened system of free trade;
    and that, meantime, it is for our interest to continue the
    system; or even though it totally fails in producing any
    augmentation in our exports, it is obviously for our advantage
    to continue it, as it brings in the immediate benefit of
    purchasing articles imported at a cheaper rate. Supposing, say
    they, we obtain no corresponding advantage from other states,
    there is an immense benefit accrues to ourselves from admitting
    foreign goods at a nominal duty, from the low price at which
    they may be purchased by the British consumer. To that point we
    shall advert in the sequel; in the mean time, it may be
    considered as demonstrated, that the free trade system has
    entirely failed in procuring for us the slightest extension of
    our foreign exports, or abating in the slightest degree the
    jealousy of foreign nations at our maritime and manufacturing
    superiority. Nor is there any difficulty in discovering to what
    this failure has been owing. It arises <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page386"
       name="page386"></a>[pg 386]</span> from laws inherent in the
       nature of things, and which will remain unabated as long as
       we continue a great and prosperous nation.</p>

    <p>It is related of the Lacedemonians, that while all the other
    citizens of Greece were careful to surround their towns with
    walls, they alone left a part open on all sides. Thus,
    superiority in the field rendered them indifferent to the
    adventitious protection of ramparts. It is for a similar reason
    that England is now willing to throw down the barriers of
    tariffs, and the impediments of custom-houses; and that all
    other nations are fain to raise them up. It is a secret sense
    of superiority on the one side, and of inferiority on the
    other, which is the cause of the difference. We advocate
    freedom of trade, because we are conscious that, in a fair
    unrestricted competition, we should succeed in beating them out
    of their own market. They resist it, and loudly clamour for
    protection, because they are aware that such a result would
    speedily take place, and that the superiority of the old
    commercial state is such, that on an open trial of strength, it
    must at once prove fatal to its younger rivals. As this effect
    is thus the result of permanent causes affecting both sides, it
    may fairly be presumed that it will be lasting; and that the
    more anxiously the old manufacturing state advocates or acts
    upon freedom of commercial intercourse, the more strenuously
    will the younger and rising ones advocate protection.
    Reciprocity, therefore, is out of the question between them:
    for it never could exist without the destruction of the
    manufactures of the younger state; and if that state has begun
    to enter on the path of manufacturing industry, it never will
    be permitted by its government.</p>

    <p>But this is not all. If free trade must of necessity prove
    fatal to the manufactures of the younger state, it as certainly
    leads to the destruction <i>of the agriculture of the
    older;</i> and it is this double effect this RECIPROCITY OF
    EVIL, which renders it so disastrous and impracticable an
    experiment for both the older and the younger community. The
    reason of this has not hitherto been generally attended to; but
    when once it is stated, its force becomes obvious, and it
    furnishes the true answer on principle to the delusive
    doctrines of free trade.</p>

    <p>Nature has established, and, as it will immediately be
    shown, for very wise and important purposes, a permanent and
    indelible distinction between the effect of civilization and
    opulence on the production of food, and on the preparation of
    manufactures. In the latter, the discoveries of science, the
    exertions of skill, the application of capital, the
    introduction of machinery, are all-powerful, and give the older
    and more advanced state an immediate and decisive advantage
    over the younger and the ruder. In the former, the very reverse
    takes place: the additions made to productive power are
    comparatively inconsiderable, even by the most important
    discoveries; and as this capital and industry have in the end a
    powerful effect, and always enable the power of raising food
    for the human race to keep far a-head of the wants of mankind;
    yet this effect takes place very slowly, and the annual
    addition that can be made to the produce of the earth by such
    means is by no means considerable. The introduction of thorough
    draining will probably increase the productive power of the
    soil in Great Britain a third: scientific discovery may perhaps
    add another third; but at least ten years must elapse in the
    most favourable view before these effects generally take
    place&mdash;ere the judicious and well-directed labours of our
    husbandmen have formed rivulets for the superfluous wet of our
    fields, or overspread the soil with the now wasted animal
    remains of our cities. But our manufactures can in a few years
    quadruple their produce. So vast is the power which the
    steam-engine has made to the powers of production in commercial
    industry, that it is susceptible to almost indefinite and
    immediate extension; and the great difficulty always felt is,
    not to get hands to keep pace with the demand of the consumers,
    but to get a demand to keep pace with the hands employed in the
    production. Manchester and Glasgow could, in a few years,
    furnish muslin and cotton goods for the whole world.</p>

    <p>Nor is the difference less important and conspicuous in the
    <i>price</i> at which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page387"
       name="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span> manufacturing and
       agricultural produce can be raised in the old and the young
       state. This is the decisive circumstance which renders
       reciprocity between them impossible. The rich old state is
       as superior to the young one in the production of
       manufactures, as the poor young state is to the rich old one
       in that of subsistence. The steam-engine, capital, and
       machinery, have so enormously increased the power of
       manufacturing production, that they have rendered the old
       commercial state omnipotent in the foreign market in the
       supply of its articles. Nothing but fiscal regulations and
       heavy duties can protect the young state from ruin in those
       branches of industry. Heavy taxes, high wages, costly rents,
       dear rude produce, all are at once compensated, and more
       than compensated, by the gigantic powers of the
       steam-engine. Cotton goods are raised now in Great Britain
       at a fifth of the price which they were during the war. A
       gown, which formerly was cheap at &pound;2, 10s., is now
       sold for ten shillings. Silks, muslins, and all other
       articles of female apparel, have been reduced in price in
       the same proportion. Colossal fortunes have been made by the
       master manufacturers, unbounded wealth diffused through the
       operative workmen in Lancashire and Lanarkshire, even at
       these extremely reduced prices. This is the real reason of
       the universal effort made by all nations which have the
       least pretensions to commercial industry, of late years to
       exclude, by fixed duties, our staple manufactures; of which
       the President of the Board of Trade so feelingly complains,
       and which the advocates of free trade consider as so
       inexplicable. A very clear principle has led to it, and will
       lead to it. It is the instinct of SELF-PRESERVATION.</p>

    <p>But there is no steam-engine in agriculture. The old state
    has no superiority over the young one in the price of producing
    food; on the contrary, it is decidedly its inferior. There, as
    in love, the apprentice is the master. The proof of this is
    decisive. Poland can raise wheat with ease at fifteen or twenty
    shillings a quarter, while England requires fifty. The serf of
    the Ukraine would make a fortune on the price at which the
    farmer of Kent or East Lothian would be rendered bankrupt. The
    Polish cultivators have no objection whatever to a free
    competition with the British; but the British anticipate, and
    with reason, total destruction from the free admission of
    Polish grain. These facts are so notorious, that they require
    no illustration; but nevertheless the conclusion to which they
    point is of the highest importance, and bears, with
    overwhelming force, on the theory of free trade as between an
    old and a young community. They demonstrate that that theory is
    not only practically pernicious, but on principle erroneous. It
    involves an oblivion of the fundamental law of nature as to the
    difference between the effect of wealth and civilization on the
    production of food and the raising of manufactures. It proceeds
    on insensibility to the difference in the age and advancement
    of nations, and the impossibility of a reciprocity being
    established between them without the ruin of an important
    branch of industry in each. It supposes nations to be of the
    same genus and age, like the trees in the larch plantation, not
    of all varieties and ages, as in the natural forest. If
    established in complete operation, it would only lead to the
    ruin of the manufactures of the younger state, and of the
    agriculture of the old one. The only reciprocity which it can
    ever introduce between such states is the reciprocity of
    evil.</p>

    <p>Illustrations from everyday life occur on all sides to
    elucidate the utter absurdity, and, in fact, total
    impracticapability of the system of free trade, as applied to
    nations who are, or are becoming, rivals of each other in
    manufacturing industry. Those who have the advantage, will
    always advocate free competition; those who are labouring under
    impediments, will always exclaim against them. In some cases
    the young have the advantage, in others the old; but in all the
    free system is applauded by those in the sunshine, and
    execrated by those in the shade. The fair <i>debutante</i> of
    eighteen, basking in the bright light of youth, beauty, birth,
    and connections, has no sort of objection to the freedom of
    choice in the ball-room. If the mature spinster of forty would
    divulge her real opinion, what would it be on the same scene of
    competition? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page388"
       name="page388"></a>[pg 388]</span> Experience proves that
       she is glad to retire, in the general case, from the unequal
       struggle, and finds the system of established precedence and
       fixed rank at dinner parties, much more rational. The
       leaders on the North Circuit&mdash;Sir James Scarlett or
       Lord Brongham&mdash;have no objections to the free choice,
       by solicitors and attorneys, for professional talent; but
       their younger brethren of the gown are fain to take shelter
       from such formidable rivals in the exclusive employment of
       the Crown, the East India Company, the Bank of England, or
       some of the numerous chartered companies in the country.
       England is the old lawyer on the Cirucuit in
       manufactures&mdash;but Poland is the young beauty of the
       ball-room in agriculture. We should like to see what sort of
       reciprocity could be established between them. Possibly the
       young belle may exchange her beauty for the old lawyer's
       guineas, but it will prove a bad reciprocity for both.</p>

    <p>It is usual for both philosophers and practical men to
    ascribe the superior cheapness with which subsistence can be
    raised in the young state to the old one, to the weight of
    taxes and of debt, public and private, with which the latter is
    burdened, from which the former is, in general, relieved. But,
    without disputing that these circumstances enter with
    considerable weight into the general result, it may safely be
    affirmed that the main cause of it is to be found in two laws
    of nature, of universal and permanent application. These are
    the low value of money in the rich state, in consequence of its
    plenty, compared with its high value in the poor one, in
    consequence of its poverty, and the experienced inapplicability
    of machinery or the division of labour to agricultural
    operations.</p>

    <p>Labour is cheap in the poor state, such as Poland, Prussia,
    and the Ukraine, becuase guineas are few.&mdash;"It is not," as
    Johnson said of the Highlands, "that eggs are many, but that
    pence are few." Commercial transactions being scanty, and the
    want of a circulating medium inconsiderable, it exists to a
    very limited extent in the country. People do not need a large
    circulating medium, therefore they do not buy it; they are
    poor, therefore they cannot. In the opulent and highly advanced
    community, on the other hand, the reverse of all this takes
    place. Transactions are so frequent, the necessities of
    commerce so extensive, that a large circulating medium is soon
    felt to be indispensable. In addition to a considerable amount
    of specie, the aid of bank-notes, public and private, of
    Government securities and exchequer bills, and of private bills
    to an immense ammount, bcomes necessary. McCulloch calculates
    the circulating medium of Great Britain, including paper and
    gold, at L.72,000,000. The bills in circulation are probably in
    amount nearly as much more. A hundred and forty, or a hundred
    and fifty millions, between specie, bank-notes, exchequer
    bills, Government securities, on which advances are made, and
    private bills, constitute the ordinary circulating medium of
    twenty-seven millions in the British empire. The total
    circulation of Russia, with sixty millions of inhabitants, is
    not forty millions sterling. The effect of this difference is
    prodigions. It is no wonder, whten it is taken into account,
    that wages are 5-1/2d. or 6d. a-day in Poland or the Ukraine,
    and 2s. or 2s. 6d. a-day in England.</p>

    <p>The clearest proof that this is the great cause of the
    superior cost of raising subsistence in the old than the young
    state, is afforded by the different value which money bears in
    different parts of the <i>same</i> community. Ask any
    housekeeper what is the difference between the expense of
    living in London, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen, and he will answer,
    that L.1500 a-year in Edingburgh, or L.750 in Aberdeen. Yet
    these different places are all situated in the same community,
    and their inhabitants pay the same public taxes, and very
    nearly the same of local ones. It is the vast results arising
    from the concentration of wealth and expediture in one place,
    compared with its abstraction from others, which occasions the
    difference. But if this effect is conspicuous, and matter of
    daily observation, in different parts of the same compact and
    moderately sized country, how much more must it obtain in
    regard to different countries, situated in different latitudes
    and politcal circumstances, and in different stages
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page389"
       name="page389"></a>[pg 389]</span> of wealth, civilization,
       and commercial opulence? Between England for example, and
       Poland or the Ukraine? The difference is there important and
       durable. Wheat can be raised with as good a profit to the
       cultivator for sixteen shillings per quarter in Poland, as
       for forty-eight shillings in England or Scotland.</p>

    <p>This superior weight of wages, rent and all the elements of
    cost, in the old, when compared with the young community,
    affects the manufacturer as well as the farmer; and in some
    branches of manufactures it does so with an overwhelming
    effect. But, generally speaking, the advantages of capital,
    machinery, and the division of labour, render the old state
    altogether predominant over the young one in these particulars.
    It would seem to be a fixed law of nature, that the progress of
    society adds almost nothing to the application of machinery to
    agriculture, but indefinitely to its importance in
    manufactures. Observe an old man digging his garden with a
    spade&mdash;that is the most productive species of cultivation;
    it is the last stage of agricultural progress to return to it.
    No steam engines or steam ploughs will ever rival it. But what
    is the old weaver toiling with his hands, to the large
    steam-power mill, turning at once ten thousand spindles? As
    dust in the balance. Man, by a beneficent law of his Maker, is
    permanently secured in his first and best pursuit. It is in
    those which demoralize and degrade, that machinery
    progressively encroaches on the labour of his hands. England
    can undersell India in muslins and printed goods, manufactured
    in Lancashire or Lanarkshire, out of cotton which grew on the
    banks of the Ganges; for England though younger in years
    compared to India, is old in civilization, wealth, and power.
    We should like to see what profit would be made by exporting
    wheat from England, raised on land paying thirty shillings an
    acre of rent, by labourers paid at two shillings a-day, to
    Hindostan, where rice is raised twice a-year, on land paying
    five shillings an acre rent, by labourers receiving twopence
    a-day each.</p>

    <p>It is the constant operation of this law of nature which
    ensures the equalization of empires, the happiness of society,
    and the dispersion of mankind. To be convinced of this, we have
    only to reflect on the results which would ensue if this were
    not the case; if no unvarying law gave man in remote situations
    an advantage in raising subsistence over what they enjoy in the
    centres of opulence; and agriculture, in the aged and wealthy
    community, was able to acquire the same decisive superiority
    over distant and comparatively poor ones, which we see daily
    examplified in the production of manufactures. Suppose, for
    example, that in consequence of the application of the
    steam-engine, capital, and machinery to the raising of
    subsistence, Great Britian could undersell the cultivatiors of
    Poland and the Ukraine as effectually as she does their
    manufacturers in the production of cotton goods; that she could
    sell in the Polish market wheat at five shillings a quarter,
    when they require fifteen shillings to remunerate the cost of
    production. Would not the result be, that commerce between them
    would be entirely destroyed; that subsistence would be
    exclusively raised in the old opulent community; that mankind
    would congregate in fearful multitudes round the great
    commercial emporium of the world; and that the industry and
    progress of the more distant nations would be irrevocably
    blighted? Whereas, by the operation of the present law of
    nature, that the rich state can always undersell the poor one
    in maufactures, and the poor one always undersell the rich one
    in subsistence, those dangers are removed, a check is provided
    to the undue multiplication of the species in particular
    situations, and the dispersion of mankind over the
    globe&mdash;a vital object in the system of nature&mdash;is
    secured, from the very necessities and difficulties in which,
    in the progress of society, the old and wealthy community
    becomes involved.</p>

    <p>These considerations point out an important limitation to
    which, on principle, the doctrines of free trade must be
    subjected. Perfectly just in reference to a single community,
    or a compact empire of reasonable extent, they wholly fail when
    applied to separate nations in different degrees of
    civilization, or even to different provinces of the same
    empire, when it is of such an extent as to bring such
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page390"
       name="page390"></a>[pg 390]</span> different nations, in
       various degrees of progress, under one common dominion. They
       were suggested, in the first instance, to philosophers, by
       the absurd restrictions on the commerce of grain which
       existed in France under the old monarchy, and which Turgot
       and the Economists laboured so assiduously to abolish. There
       can be no doubt that they were perfectly right in doing so;
       for France is a compact, homogeneous country, in which the
       cost of producing subsistence is not materially different in
       one part from another, and the interests of the whole
       community are closely identified. The same holds with the
       interchange of grain between the different provinces of
       Spain, or for the various parts of the British islands. But
       the case is widely different with an empire so extensive as,
       like the British in modern or the Roman in ancient times, to
       embrace separate kingdoms, in wholly different circumstances
       of climate, progress, and social condition. Free trade, in
       such circumstances, must lead to a destruction of important
       interests, and a total subversion of the balance of society
       in both the kingdoms subjected to it. To be conviced of
       this, we have only to look at the present condition of the
       British, or the past fate of the Roman empire.</p>

    <p>It is the boast of our manufacturers&mdash;and such a marvel
    may well afford a subject for exultation&mdash;that with cotton
    which grew on the banks of the Ganges, they can, by the aid of
    British capital, machinery, and enterprise, undersell, in the
    production of muslin and cotton goods, the native Indian
    manufacturers, who work up their fabrics in the close vicinity
    of the original cotton-fields. The constant and increasing
    export of Britsh goods to India, two-thirds of which are
    cotton, demonstrates that this superiority really exists; and
    that the muslin manufacturers in Hindostan, who work for 3d.
    a-day on their own cotton, cannot stand the competition of the
    British operatives, who receive 3s. 6d. a-day, aided as they
    are by the almost miraculous powers of the steam-engine. Free
    trade, therefore, is ruinous to the manufacturing interests of
    India; and accordingly the Parliamentary proceedings are filled
    with evidence of the extreme misery which has been brought on
    the native manufacturers of Hindostan by that free importation
    of British goods, in which our political economists so much and
    so fully exult.</p>

    <p>The great distance of India from the British islands, the
    vast expense of transporting bulky articles eight thousand
    miles accross the ocean, have prevented the counterpart of this
    effect taking place; and the British farmers feeling the
    depressing influence of the Indian plough, in like manner as
    the Indian manufacturers have the ruinous competition of the
    British steam-engine. But it is clear that, if India had been
    nearer, the former effect would have taken place as well as the
    latter. If the shores of Hindostan were within a few days sail
    of London and Liverpool, and the Indian cultivators, labouring
    at 2d. or 3d. a-day, had been brought into direct competition
    with the British farmers, employing labourers who received two
    or three shillings, can there be a doubt that the British
    farmers would have been totally destroyed in the struggle? The
    English farmers would have been prostrated by the same cause
    which has ruined the Indian muslin manufacturers. Cheap grain,
    the fruit of free trade, would have demolished British
    agriculture as completely as cheap cotton goods, the fruits of
    unlimited importation, has ruined Indian manufacturing
    industry.</p>

    <p>Is, then, commercial intercourse impossible, on terms of
    mutual benefit, between states in widely different
    circumstatnces of commercial or agricultural advancement; and
    is the only reciprocity which can exist between them and
    reciprocity of evil? It is by no means necessary to rest in so
    unsatisfatory a conclusion. A most advantageous commercial
    intercourse to both parties may be carried on, but it must not
    be on the footing of free trade. The foundation of such an
    intercourse should be, that each should take, on the most
    favourable terms, the articles which <i>it wants and does not
    produce</i>, and impose restrictions on those which <i>it wants
    and does produce</i>. On this priciple, trade would be
    conducted so as to benefit both countries, and injure neither.
    Thus England may take from India to the utmost extent, and with
    perfect safety, sugar, indigo, cotton, tea, spices, cinnamon,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page391"
       name="page391"></a>[pg 391]</span> and the more costly
       species of shawls; while India might take from England some
       species of cotton manufacture in which they have no fabrics
       of their own, cutlery, hardware, and all of the various
       luxuries of European manufacture. But a paternal and just
       government, equally alive to the interests of all its
       provinces, how far removed soever from the seat of power,
       would impose restrictions to prevent India being deluged
       with British cottons, to the ruin of its native
       manufactures, and to prevent Britian&mdash;if the distance
       did not operate, which it certainly would, as a sufficient
       protection&mdash;from being flooded with Indian grain. The
       varieties of climate, productions, and wants, in different
       countries, are such, that commerce, regulated on these
       principles, might be carried to the greatest extent
       consistent with the paramount duty of providing in each
       state for the preservation of its staple articles of
       industry.</p>

    <p>The Roman empire in ancient times afforded the clearest
    demonstration of the truth of these principles; and the fate of
    their vast dominion shows, in the most decisive manner, what is
    the inevitable consequence to which the free trade principles,
    now so strongly contended for by a party in this country, must
    lead. Alison is the first modern author with whom we are
    acquainted, who has traced the decline of the Roman empire in
    great part to this source. In the tenth volume of his "History
    of Europe," p. 752, we find the following passage:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"No nation can pretend to independence which rests for
        any sensible protion of its subsistence in ordinary seasons
        on foreign, who may become hostile, nations. And if we
        would see a memorable example of the manner in which the
        greatest and most powerful nation may, in the course of
        ages, come to be paralysed by this cause, we have only to
        cast our eyes on imperial Rome, when the vast extent of the
        empire had practically established a free trade in grain
        with the whole civilized world; and the result was, that
        cultivation disappeared from the Italian plains, that the
        race of Roman agriculturists, the strength of the empire,
        became extinct, that the fields were laboured only by
        slaves and cattle. The legions could no longer be recruited
        but from foreign bands, vast tracts of pasturage overspread
        even the fields of Lombardy and the Compagna of Naples, and
        it was the plaintive confession of the Roman annalist, that
        the mistress of the world had come to depend for her
        subsistence on the floods of the Nile."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This observation has excited, as well it might, the vehement
    indignation of the free trade journals. The example of the
    greates and most powerful nation that ever existed being
    weakened, and at length ruined by a free trade in corn,
    afforded too cogent an argument, and was too striking a
    warning, not to excite the wrath of those who would precipitate
    Great Britain into a similar course of policy. They have
    attacked the author, accordingly, with unwonted asperity; and,
    while they admint the ruin of Italian agriculture in the later
    stages of the Roman empire, endeavour to ascribe it to the
    gratuitous distribution of grain to the Roman populace, not the
    effect of a free importation of grain from its Egyptian and
    African provinces. The vast importance of the subject has
    induced us to look into the original authorities to whom Alison
    refers in support of his observation, and from among them we
    select three&mdash;Tacitus, Gibbon, and Michelet. Tacitus
    says,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"At Hercule <i>olim ex Itaila</i> legionibus longinquas
        in provincias commeatus portabantur, <i>nec nunc
        infecunditate laboratur</i>; sed Africam <i>potius et
        Egyptum exercemus</i>, navibusque et casibus vita populi
        Romani permissa est."&mdash;TACITUS, <i>Annal</i>. xii.
        43.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Antiquity does not contain a more pregnant and important
    passage, or one more directly bearing on the present policy of
    the Britsh emprire, than this. It demonstrates: 1, That in
    former times Italy had been an exporting country: "<i>olim</i>
    ex Italia commeatus in longinquas provincias portabantur." 2,
    That at the time when Tacitus wrote, in the days of the Emperor
    Trajan, it had ceased to be so, and had come to import largely
    from Africa and Lybia, "sed <i>nunc</i> Africam potius et
    Egyptum exercemus." 3, That this was not the result of any
    supervening sterility or unfruitfulness, "nec nunc
    infecunditate laboratur," but was from causes which made it
    more profitable to purchase grain in the Egyptian or Lybian
    markets, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392"
       name="page392"></a>[pg 392]</span> "sed Africam POTIUS et
       Egyptum exercemus."</p>

    <p>Of the extent to which this decay of agriculture in the
    central provinces of the Roman empire went, in the latter
    stages of its history, we have the following striking account
    in the authentic pages of Gibbon:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Since the age of Tiberius <i>the decay of agriculture
        had been felt in Italy</i>; and it was a just subject of
        complaint that the life of the Roman people depended on the
        accidents of the winds and the waves. In the division and
        decline of the empire, <i>the tributary harvests of Egypt
        and Africa</i> were withdrawn; the numbers of the
        inhabitants continually diminished with the means of
        subsistence; and the country was exhausted by the
        irretrievable losses of war, pestilence, and famine. Pope
        Gelasius was a subject of Odoacer, and he affirms, with
        strong exaggeration, that, in Emilia, Tuscany, and the
        adjacent provinces, the human species was almost
        extirpated."&mdash;GIBBON, vol. vi. c. xxxvi. p. 235.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Of the progress and extent of this decay, Gibbon gives the
    following account in another part of his great work:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The agriculture of the Roman provinces <i>was
        insensibly ruined</i>; and in the progress of despotism,
        which tends to disappoint its own purpose, the emperors
        were obliged to derive some merit from the forgiveness of
        debts, or the remission of tributes, which their subjects
        were utterly incapable of paying. According to the new
        division of Italy, the fertile and happy province of
        Campania, the scene of the early victories and of the
        delicious retirements of the citizens of Rome, extended
        between the sea and the Apennines, from the Tiber to the
        Silarius. Within sixty years after the death of
        Constantine, and on the evidence of an actual survey, an
        exemption was granted in favour of 330,000 English acres
        <i>of desert and uncultivated land, which amounted to
        one-eighth of the whole surface of the province</i>. As the
        footsteps of the barbarians had not yet been seen in Italy,
        the cause of this amazing desolation, which is recorded in
        the laws, (Cod. Theod. lxi. t. 38, l. 2,) can be ascribed
        only to the administration of the Roman
        emperors."&mdash;GIBBON, vol. iii. c. xviii. p. 87. Edition
        in 12 volumes.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Michelet observes, in his late profound and able History of
    France&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The Christian emperors could not remedy the growing
        depopulation of the country any more than their heathen
        predecessors. All their efforts only showed the impotence
        of government to arrest that dreadful evil. Sometimes,
        alarmed at the depopulation, they tried to mitigate the lot
        of the farmer, to shield him against the landlord; upon
        this the proprietor exclaimed he could no longer pay the
        taxes. At other times they abandoned the farmer,
        surrendered him to the landlord, and strove to chain him to
        the soil; but the unhappy cultivators perished or fled,
        <i>and the land became deserted</i>. Even in the time of
        Augustus, efforts were made to arrest the depopulation at
        the expense of morals, by encouraging concubinage. Pertinax
        granted an immunity from taxes to those who could occupy
        the desert lands of Italy, <i>to the cultivators of the
        distant provinces, and the allied kings</i>. Aurelian did
        the same. Probus was obliged to transport from Germany men
        and oxen to cultivate Gaul.<a id="footnotetag13"
           name="footnotetag13"></a><a href=
           "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> Maximian and Constantius
           transported the Franks and Germans from Picardy and
           Hainault into Italy: but the depopulation in the towns
           and the country alike continued. The people surrendered
           themselves in the fields to despair, as a beast of
           burden lies down beneath his load and refuses to rise.
           In vain the emperor strove, by offers of immunities and
           exemptions, to recall the cultivator to his deserted
           fields. Nothing could do so. The desert extended daily.
           At the commencement of the fifth century there was, in
           the <i>happy</i> Campania, the most fertile province of
           the empire, 520,000 <i>jugera</i> in a state of
           nature."&mdash;MICHELET, <i>Histoire de France</i>, i.
           104-108.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Pursued to its very grave by the same deep-rooted cause of
    evil, the strength of Italy, even in the last stages of its
    decay, was still prostrated by the importation of grain from
    Egypt and Lybia. "The Campagna of Rome," says Gibbon, "about
    the close of the sixth century, was reduced to the state of
    <i>a dreary wilderness</i>, in which the land was barren,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page393"
       name="page393"></a>[pg 393]</span> the waters impure, and
       the air infectious. Yet the number of citizens <i>still
       exceeded the measure of subsistence; their precarious food
       was supplied from the harvests of Egypt and Lybia</i>; and
       the frequent repetitions of famine betray the inattention of
       the emperors to a distant provice."&mdash;GIBBON, vil. viii.
       c. xlv. 162.</p>

    <p>Nor was this desolating scourge of foreign importation
    confined to Italy; it obtained also in Greece equally with the
    Ausonian fields, the abode of early riches, opulence, and
    prosperity. "In the later stages of the empire," says Michelet,
    "Greece was almost entirely <i>supported by corn raised in the
    fields of Podolia</i>," (Poland.)&mdash;MICHELET, i. 277.</p>

    <p>Now let it be recollected that this continual and
    astonishing decline of agriculture, and disappearance of the
    rural cultivators in the latter stages of the Roman empire,
    took place in an empire which contained, as Gibbon tells us,
    120,000,000 of inhabitants, and 1600 great cities, was 3000
    miles long and 2000 miles broad, contained 1,600,000 square
    miles, chiefly fertile and well cultivated land, which embraced
    the fairest and most fertile portions of the earth, and which
    had been governed for eighty yers under the successive sway of
    Nerva, Adrian, Trajan, and the two Antonines, with consummate
    wisdon and the most paternal spirit. <a id="footnotetag14"
       name="footnotetag14"></a><a href=
       "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> The scourge of foreign war,
       the devastation of foreign armies, were alike unknown;
       profound tranquillity pervaded every part of the empire; and
       a vast inland lake, spreading its ample waters through the
       heart of the dominion, afforded to all its provinces the
       most perfect facility of intercourse with the metropolis and
       the central parts of the empire. Yet this period&mdash;the
       period which Mr Hume has told us the philosophers would
       select as the happiest the human race had ever
       known&mdash;was precisely that during which agriculture so
       rapidly declined in the Italian and Grecian fields, during
       which the sturdy race of free cultivators disappeared, and
       the plains of Italy were entirely absorbed by pasturage, and
       maintained only vast herds of cattle tended by slaves.</p>

    <p>What was it, then, which in an empire containing so immense
    a population, and such boundless resources, drawn forth and
    developed under so wise and beneficent a race of emperors,
    occasioned this constant and uninterrupted decay of
    agriculture, and at length the total destruction of the rural
    population in the heart of the empire? How did it happen that
    Italian cultivation receded, as Tacitus and Gibbon tell us it
    did, <i>from the time of Tiberius</i>; and equally under the
    wisdom of the Antonines, as the tyranny of Nero, or the civil
    wars of Vitellius? Some general and durable cause must have
    been in operation during all this period, which at firest
    depressed, and at length totally destroyed, the numerous body
    of free Italian cultivators who so long had constituted the
    strength of the legions, and had borne the Roman eagles,
    conquering and to conquer, to the very extremities of the
    habitable earth. The cause is apparent. It was the free
    importation of Egyptian and Lybian grain, consequent on the
    extension of the Roman dominion over their fertile fields,
    which effected the result. Were England to extend its
    conquering arms over Poland and the Ukraine, and, as a
    necessary consequence, expose the British farmer to the
    unrestrained competition of Polish and Russian wheat, precisely
    the same result would ensue. If the shores of Hindostan were
    within three or four days' sail of the Tiber, this result would
    long ago have taken place. Let Polish and Russian grain be
    admitted without a protecting duty into the British harbours,
    as Lybian and Egyptian were into those of Italy, and we shall
    soon see the race of cultivators disappear from the fields of
    England as they did from those of old Rome, and the words of
    Tacitus will, by a mere change of proper names, become a
    picture of our condition; three hundred thousand acres will
    soon be reduced to a state of nature in Kent <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="page394"
       name="page394"></a>[pg 394]</span> and Norfolk, as they were
       in the Campania Felix. "Nec nunc infecunditate laboramur,
       <i>Podoliam</i> potius et <i>Scythiam</i> exercemus,
       navibusque et casibus vita populi <i>Anglici</i> permissa
       est."</p>

    <p>The free traders allege that the decay of agriculture in the
    central provinces of the Roman empire, to which, by the
    concurring testimony of all historians, the ruin of the
    dominion of the Caesars was chiefly owing, is to be ascribed,
    not to the free importation of grain from Egypt, Podolia, and
    Lybia, but to the tyranny of the emperors, the gratuitous
    distribution of grain to the Roman populace, and the dreadful
    evils of domestic slavery. A very slight consideration,
    however, must be sufficient to show that these causes, how
    powerful soever in producing <i>general</i> evils over the
    empire, could not have been instrumental in occasioning those
    <i>peculiar</i> and separate causes of depression, which so
    early began to check, and at length totally destroyed, the
    agriculture of its central provinces.</p>

    <p>The tyranny of the Caesars, the oppression of the
    Proconsuls, the avarice of the Patricians, were general evils,
    affecting alike every part of the empire; or rather they were
    felt with more severity in the remote provinces than the
    districts nearer home, in consequence of the superior
    opportunities of escape which distance from the central
    government afforded to iniquity, and the lesser chance of
    success which the insurrection of a remote province held forth
    to the "wild revenge" of rebellion. Muscovite oppression,
    accordingly, is more severely felt at Odessa or Taganrog than
    St Petersburg; and British rule is far from being restrained by
    the same considerations of justice on the banks of the Ganges
    or the Indus, as on those of the Thames. The gratuitous
    distribution of grain by the emperors to the populace of Rome,
    could never have occasioned the ruin of the Italian
    <i>cultivators</i>. Supposing that the two or three hundred
    thousand lazy and turbulent plebeians, who were nourished by
    the bounty or fed by the terrors of the Caesars, were the most
    useless, worthless, and dangerous set of men that ever existed,
    (which they probably were,) that circumstance could never have
    uprooted the race of cultivators from the plains of Lombardy,
    Umbria, or the Campania Felix. The greatest possible good to a
    nation, according to the free trader, is cheap grain, and never
    more so than when it is purchased or imported from foreign
    growers. If this be true, the importation of the harvests of
    Egypt and Africa into the Italian harbours, either by the
    voluntary purchase of the Roman emperors, or the forced tribute
    in grain which they exacted from those provinces, must have
    been the greatest possible benefit to the Italian people. How
    then, if there be no mischief in such foreign importations, is
    it possible to ascribe the ruin of Italian cultivation, and
    with it of the Roman empire, to these forced contributions? If
    the free traders have recourse to such an argument, they
    concede the very point in dispute, and admit that the
    introduction of foreign grain is injurious, and may in the end
    prove fatal, to the agriculture and existence of a state.</p>

    <p>Slavery, though a great evil, will as little explain the
    peculiar and extraordinary decline of Italian and Grecian
    cultivation in the later stages of the Roman empire. The
    greater part of the labour of the ancient world, as every one
    knows, was conducted by means of slaves. They were slaves who
    held the plough, and tilled the land, and tended the flocks,
    equally in Lybia, in Campania, in Egypt, as in Umbria. Nay, the
    number of freemen, at least in the days of the Roman Republic,
    and the earlier periods of the empire, was incomparably
    <i>greater</i> in Italy and Greece, the abode of celebrated,
    powerful, and immortal republics, than in Lybia and Egypt,
    which from the earliest times had been subject to the despotic
    sway of satraps, kings, and tyrants. So numerous were the free
    citizens of Rome in the early days of the empire, that, by the
    census of Claudius, we are told by Gibbon they amounted to
    6,945,000 men,<a id="footnotetag15"
       name="footnotetag15"></a><a href=
       "#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> the greater proportion of
       whom, of course, were residents in Italy, the seat of
       <span class="pagenum"><a id="page395"
       name="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span> government, and the
       centre of wealth, power, and enjoyment. While so great was
       the multitude of free citizens which the Republic bequeathed
       to the empire, resident and exercising unfettered industry
       in Italy, the cultivators of Africa and Egypt were all serfs
       and slaves, toiling, like the West Indian negroes, beneath
       the lash of a master. How, then, did it happen that the
       labour of the Italian freeman was disused, and at length
       extinguished, while that of the African and Egyptian slaves
       continued to furnish grain for Italy down to the very latest
       period of the empire? We are told that the labour of freemen
       is cheaper than that of slaves; and the free traders will
       probably not dispute that proposition. It could not,
       therefore, have been the slavery of antiquity which ruined
       Italian agriculture, carried on, in part at least, by
       freemen; since African agriculture, the fruits entirely of
       slavery, continued to flourish down to the very last days of
       the Roman world.</p>

    <p>The severe taxation of the emperors is justly stated by
    Gibbon and Sismondi, as well as Michelet, as a principal cause
    of the decline of Italian agriculture: but very little
    consideration is required to show, that this cause is
    inadequate to explain this ruin of cultivation in the Italian
    plains, when it continued to flourish and maintain the chief
    cities of the empire with food, in Egypt and Lybia. Heavy as it
    was, and oppressive as it ultimately became, <i>it was
    equal</i>; it was the same every where; it might, therefore,
    satisfactorily explain the <i>general</i> decline of rural
    industry through the empire, and doubtless had a large share in
    contributing to its downfall; but it cannot explain the
    <i>particular</i> ruin of it, in the central provinces of this
    vast dominion, while it continued, down to the very last
    moment, to flourish in its remote dependencies.</p>

    <p>But the taxation of the empire, <i>when coupled with the
    free importation of grain</i> from these distant dependencies,
    does afford a most satisfactory, and, in truth, the true
    explanation of the ruin of Italian and Grecian cultivation. It
    was a fixed principle of Roman taxation, that the duties
    allotted on a particular district should remain fixed, how much
    lower the inhabitants or industry of the province might
    decline. When, therefore, by the constant importation of
    Egyptian and African grain, raised at half the cost at which
    they could produce it, the Italian cultivators were deprived of
    a remunerating return, and the taxes exacted from each district
    underwent no diminution, it is not surprising that the small
    farmers and proprietors were ruined; that they took refuge in
    the industry and crowds of cities, and that the race of freemen
    disappeared from the country. A similar process is now going on
    in the Turkish provinces. But without undervaluing&mdash;on the
    contrary, attaching full weight to this
    circumstance&mdash;nothing can be clearer than that it was the
    ruinous competition of foreign grain, raised cheaper than they
    could produce it, which rendered the same taxation crushing on
    the Italian farmers, which was borne with comparative facility
    in the remoter provinces, where land was more fertile, and
    labour less expensive. An example, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>,
    applied to the British empire, where the free traders wish us
    to admit a free importation of grain from Poland and the
    Ukraine, where not only is labour cheap but taxation trifling,
    into the British islands, where not only is labour dear but
    taxation is five times more burdensome.</p>

    <p>And for a decisive proof that it was the superior advantages
    which Egypt and Lybia enjoyed in the production of grain, and
    not any other causes, which occasioned the ruin of Italian
    agriculture, and with it the fall of the Roman empire, we have
    only to look to the condition of the Italian fields in the last
    stages of the government of the Caesars. Already, in the time
    of the elder Pliny, it had become a subject of complaint that
    the <i>great properties</i> were ruining Italy<a id=
    "footnotetag16"
       name="footnotetag16"></a><a href=
       "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>&mdash;a sure proof, when the
       great division of estates in the days of the
       Republic&mdash;when, literally speaking, "every rood had its
       man"&mdash;that some general and <span class=
       "pagenum"><a id="page396"
       name="page396"></a>[pg 396]</span> irresistible cause,
       affecting the remuneration of their industry, was
       exterminating the small proprietors. Erelong, cultivators
       ceased entirely in the country, and the huge estates of the
       nobles were cultivated exclusively in pasturage, and by
       means of slaves. "La classe," says Michelet, "<i>des petits
       cultivateurs peu &agrave; pee a disparu</i>; les grands
       proprietaires qui leur succed&egrave;rent y
       supple&egrave;rent par des esclaves."<a id="footnotetag17"
       name="footnotetag17"></a><a href=
       "#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>It is recorded by Ammianus
       Marcellinus, that when Rome was taken by the Goths, it
       contained 1,200,000 inhabitants, and was mainly supported by
       1780 great families, who cultivated their ample estates in
       Italy in pasturage, by means of slaves.<a id="footnotetag18"
       name="footnotetag18"></a><a href=
       "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a> For centuries before, the
       threat of blockading the Tiber had been found to be the most
       effectual way of coercing the Roman populace; and whenever
       it took place, famine ensued, not only in Rome, but the
       Italian provinces. The diminution of its agricultural
       produce had, long before, been stated by Columella at
       <i>nine-tenths</i>, and by Varro at <i>three-fourths</i>, of
       what at one period had been raised. Yet such was the wealth
       of the Roman nobles, derived from pasturage, that some of
       them had L.160,000 a-year.<a id="footnotetag19"
       name="footnotetag19"></a><a href=
       "#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a> Agriculture, therefore, was
       destroyed; grain was no longer raised in Italy; Rome was
       wholly dependent on foreign supplies&mdash;but pasturage was
       undecayed; and colossal fortunes were enjoyed by a wealthy
       race of great proprietors, who managed their vast estates by
       means of slaves, and had bought up and absorbed the
       properties of the whole free cultivators in the country.
       Such was the effect&mdash;such was the result&mdash;of a
       free trade in grain in ancient times.</p>

    <p>The free traders seem not insensible to these inevitable
    results of their favourite principles; but they meet them by
    describing such consequences as rather advantageous than
    injurious. If England, say they, can raise iron and cotton
    goods cheaper than Poland, and Poland and Russia grain cheaper
    than England, then the interest of each require tht they should
    follow out these branches of industry, and it is impolitic to
    strive against it. Let, then, England admit foreign grain on a
    nominal duty, and this will in the end induce Russia and
    Prussia to admit English manufactured goods on equally
    favourable terms; and thus the real interests of both countries
    will in the end be promoted.</p>

    <p>There are two objections to this system. In the first place,
    it is impracticable if it were expedient. In the second, it is
    inexpedient if it were practicable.</p>

    <p>It is impracticable if it were expedient. Theoretical
    writers may coolly discuss in their closets the total
    destruction of various important branches of industry, the
    "absorption" of the persons engaged in them in other pursuits,
    and the transference of national capital and industry from
    agriculture to manufactures, and <i>vice vers&agrave;</i>; but
    it is impossible to effect such changes by the voluntary act of
    government, even in the most despotic country. We say by the
    voluntary act of government; because there is no doubt that it
    may be effected, though at an enormous sacrifice of life,
    wealth, and happiness, by the silent and unobserved operation
    of the laws of nature, which are irresistible; as was the case
    with the transference of industry from agriculture to
    pasturage, under the effect of free trade in grain in the
    countries bordering on the Mediterranean, in the later stages
    of the Roman empire; or from manufactures to agriculture, from
    the consequences of the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in
    the Italian republics in modern times. But no government, not
    even that of the Czar Peter or Sultaun Mahmoud, could succeed
    in destroying or nipping in the bud brances of national
    industry, by simple acts of the legislature or sovereign
    authority, not imposed by external and irresistible authority.
    The Emperor Paul tried it, and got a sash twisted about his
    neck, according to the established fashion of that country, for
    his pains. The Whigs tried it, and were turned out of office in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page397"
       name="page397"></a>[pg 397]</span> consequence. All the
       governments of Europe, despotic, constitutional, and
       democratic, meet our concessions, in favour of free trade,
       by increased protection to their manufacturers. They dare
       not destroy their rising commercial wealth any more than we
       dare destroy our old colossal agricultural investments. The
       republicans of America even exceed them in the race of
       tariffs and protection. Sixty-two per cent has lately been
       laid on our British iron goods in return for Sir Robert
       Peel's tariff; a similar duty on iron and cotton goods, it
       is well known, is contemplated in the Prussian leagues in
       Germany. The British government has at length, through its
       prime minister, spoken out firmly in support of the existing
       corn-laws. The feeling of the agricultural counties, as
       evinced at the late meetings, left them no alternative. All
       nations, under all varieties of government, situation, race,
       and political circumstances, concur in rising up to resist
       the doctrines of free trade. Necessity has enlightened,
       experience has taught them: a very clear motive urges them
       on, which is not likely to decline in strength with the
       progress of time&mdash;it is the instinct of
       self-preservation.</p>

    <p>Such a system as the free traders advocate, if practicable,
    would be to the last degree inexpedient.</p>

    <p>What would be the result? Why, that one country would become
    wholly, or in great part, agricultural, and the other wholly,
    or in great part, manufacturing. Is this a result desirable to
    either? Admitting that a city or small state, which has no
    territory which can furnish any considerable proportion of the
    subsistence which it requires, like Holland, may do well to
    attend exclusively to manufactures and commerce; or a country
    which, by the rigour of nature, or the remoteness of its
    situation, cannot attain to commercial or manufacturing
    greatness, would do well to attend exclusively to the
    cultivation or productions of the earth; the question which
    here occurs&mdash;Is such a system advisable or expedient for a
    nation which has received from the bounty of nature the means
    of rising to greatness in <i>both</i>&mdash;such as Great
    Britain, Russia, or Prussia? The free traders would have
    England sacrifice its agriculture to its manufactures, and
    Russia sacrifice its manufactures to its agriculture. Would
    such a system benefit either? Would England be happier or
    richer, more stable or more moral, if the already colossal
    amount of its manufactures were trebled; or Russia, if its
    rising iron and woolen fabrics were destroyed, and its industry
    confined exclusively to the slow return of agricultural labour?
    Is it desirable that the zone of tall chimneys, sickly faces,
    brick houses, and crowded jails, which at present spans across
    the whole of England and part of Scotland, should be doubled
    and trebled in breadth; and the fertile fields of Kent,
    Norfolk, and East Lothian, be reduced to vast unenclosed
    pastures, such as overspread Italy in the later stages of the
    Roman empire? Or is it desirable to Russia and Prussia that
    they should be for ever chained to the labour of boors, serfs,
    and shepherds, and all the vivifying and unimportant effects of
    commercial wealth be denied to their exertions? Nature has
    designed, experience recommends, a very different system.
    History tells us in all parts of the world, that it is in the
    <i>intermixture</i> of commerce and agriculture that the best
    security is to be found for social happiness and advancement,
    and the most effectual antidote provided to the evils with
    which either, when existing alone, is so prone. Mr McCulloch
    has told us, that the commerce and manufactures of Great
    Britain have now risen to such a prodigious height, that any
    further extension of them is undesirable, and that no real
    patriot would have desired them to have become so extensive as
    they already are. Is it desirable, in such a state of matters,
    to go on increasing the same splendid but perilous system, and
    to do so at the expense of the great pillar of national wealth,
    security, and independence&mdash;the land of the state?</p>

    <p>Further, the proposed system is pernicious even with
    reference to the national wealth and interests of the
    manufacturers themselves, as tending to undermine the main
    branches of our national resources, and substitute
          <span class="pagenum"><a id="page398"
       name="page398"></a>[pg 398]</span> encouragement to an
       inferior, to upholding of the superior market for our
       manufacturing industry.</p>

    <p>Although in the meetings where they address the agricultural
    constituencies, the free traders hold out that their measures
    would benefit the manufacturers, and <i>not injure the
    agriculturists</i>; yet nothing can be clearer than that this
    is a mere shallow pretext, put forth to conceal their real
    objects and the effect of their measures, and that the result
    they <i>really</i> anticipate is as different from that as the
    poles are asunder. What is the benefit they hold out to the
    community as an inducement to go into their measures? Cheap
    grain. What is the motive which stimulates all their efforts,
    and which, among themselves and in private conversation with
    all men of sense, they at once admit is their ruling object?
    <i>Reduced wages</i>; the hope of extending our export in
    foreign countries by taking an additional quantity of their
    rude produce; and diminishing the cost of production to our
    manufacturers by lowering the price of food, and with it the
    wages of labour. The whole strength of their case rests in
    these propositions. Their influence over the urban multitudes
    arises solely from the continual reiteration of these alluring
    hopes. If these effects are not to follow free trade and the
    efforts of the League, in the name of Heaven, what good are
    they to do, and why do they agitate the country and subscribe
    to the League fund? Sensible men do not throw away
    &pound;100,000 for nothing, for no benefit to themselves or
    others. But these prospects are as fallacious as they are
    alluring, and so a very few observations will demonstrate.</p>

    <p>Considered in a <i>national</i> point of view, if the matter
    is brought to this issue, the great question is&mdash;Whether
    agriculture or manufactures are the superior interests in the
    production of national wealth. Admitting that the true policy
    for government is to protect <i>all</i> the branches of
    national industry, and stoutly contending, as we do, and ever
    shall do, that the real and ultimate interests of all is the
    same, and cannot be separated&mdash;the question comes to be,
    if one fiercely demands the sacrifice of the other, and insists
    that its interests are so weighty and momentous that all others
    must be sacrificed to them, which of the two thus placed in
    jeopardy is the most momentous? which brings in most to the
    national treasury? Now, on this point the facts are as adverse
    to the arguments of the League, as on all other branches of
    their case.</p>

    <p>Take the sum total of manufactures in Great Britain and
    Ireland, accompanied with the sum total of agricultural
    production, in order to discover which of the two is the more
    valuable interest&mdash;in order that it may be discovered, if
    matters are brought to that issue that one or other must be
    abandoned, which is to be sacrificed. The choice of a wise
    government could not be doubtful, if it were necessary to make
    the selection. The agricultural productions of the British
    islands amount to L.300,000,000 a-year, while the sum total of
    manufactures of every description is only L.180,000,000. Nor
    can it be said, with any degree of truth, that the agriculture
    of the country is dependent for its existence on its
    manufactures, and would decline if they were materially
    injured; for the example of modern Italy and Flanders proves,
    that three centuries <i>after</i> a country has ceased to be
    the chief in manufacturing or commercial industry, it may
    advance with undiminished vigour and success in the production
    of agricultural riches.</p>

    <p>But this is not all. The statistical documents which have
    now been prepared with so much care by Parliament, and
    published by the accurate and indefatigable Mr Porter, himself
    a decided free trader, demonstrate that, of the manufacturing
    productions, nearly three-fourths are taken off by the home
    market, and <i>four-fifths</i> by the home and colonial market
    taken together, leaving only ONE-FIFTH for <i>the whole foreign
    markets of the world put together</i>&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The total amount of British manufactures annually
        produced is about &pound;180,000,000 worth, of which only
        &pound;47,000,000 is taken off by the whole external trade
        of the world put together, while no less than
        &pound;133,000, 000 is consumed in the home market; and of
        the foreign consumption, fully a third is absorbed by the
        British Colonies, in different parts of the world. So that
        the home and colonial trade is to the <span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="page399"
           name="page399"></a>[pg 399]</span> whole foreign put
           together as 5 to 1. And, whle the total produce of
           manufactures is &pound;180,000,000 annually, and of
           mines and minerals &pound;13,776,000, the amount of
           agricultural produce annually extracted from the soil is
           not less than &pound;300,000,000; or a half more than
           the whole manufactures and mines put together."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Further, if we compare the proportion purchased of our
    manufactures, which is taken off by foreign nations, for the
    export to whom we are required to make the sacrifice of our
    domestic agriculture, with what is consumed by our own native
    population, whether in the British islands or in our colonies
    of British descent, the difference is prodigious, and such as
    might well, even for their own sake, make the Anti-corn-law
    League pause in their career of violence. From the tables
    compiled from Porter's <i>Parliamentary Tables</i>, and the
    population of the different states to whom we export, taken
    from Malte Brun and Balbi, it appears, that while the British
    population, whether at home or abroad, consume from &pound;3 to
    &pound;5 a-head worth of our manufactures, the foreign nations
    to whom we are willing to sacrifice the British agriculturists,
    take off per head ONLY AS MANY PENCE. In preferring the one to
    the other, therefore, we are, literally speaking, penny wise
    and pound foolish.</p>

    <p>We have shown how agriculture was ruined in the Roman empire
    in Italy, by the free importation of grain from the Lybian and
    Egyptian provinces of the empire. As a contrast to that woful
    progress, the main cause of the destruction of the empire of
    the Caesars, we request the attention of our readers to the
    progress of British exports in official value, which indicates
    their amount from 1790 to 1840, premising that the <i>whole</i>
    of that period was one of protection to the British
    agriculturist; during the first twenty years of the period, by
    the effects of the war&mdash;during the last twenty-five, by
    the operation of the corn law and sliding scale, introduced in
    1814. We recommend the advocates of free trade to search the
    annals of the world for a similar instance of progress and
    prosperity flowing from, or co-existent with, the practical
    adoption of their principles.</p>

    <p>These facts, which, in truth, are altogether decisive of the
    present question, point to the great source from which the
    errors of the free trade party are derived, and which appears,
    in an especial manner, their favourite position, that cheap
    prices is an unmitigated blessing, and that the great thing to
    attend to is to increase our imports. Cheap prices of grain are
    like the Amreeta cap in Kehama; the greatest of all blessings
    is the greatest of all curses, <i>according as they arise from
    magnitude of domestic production, or magnitude of foreign
    importation</i>. Of the first we had an example during the five
    fine years in succession, from 1830 to 1835, during which the
    foreign importation was practically abolished by the abundant
    harvests, and consequent high duty on grain under the sliding
    scale. This was a period, as all the world knows, of universal
    and unexampled commercial prosperity. Of the second we had a
    memorable example during the five bad years in succession,
    which elapsed fiom 1836 to 1840, in the course of which the
    corn laws, from the effect of the same sliding scale, and the
    continued low prices, were practically abolished; and
    importations, at the close of the period, amounted to 2,500,000
    quarters, and, on an average of the whole, was little short of
    2,000,000 of quarters. And what was the result? The exportation
    of 6,000,000 of sovereigns in a single year to buy grain; an
    unexampled pressure on the money market; commercial
    embarrassments, long-continued, and severe beyond all former
    precedent; the contraction of ten millions of additional debt
    in four years, and the creation of a deficit which at length
    rose to the formidable amount, in 1842, of L.4,000,000
    sterling! And what first dispelled this distress, and arrested
    this downward and disastrous progress? The fine harvests of
    1842&mdash;the blessed sun of its long summer, followed by the
    more checkered, but also fine summer of 1843, which again gave
    us plenty, derived from domestic production, and consequent
    general and increasing manufacturing as well as rural
    prosperity.</p>

    <p>It is in vain, therefore, to say, cheap prices are a
    blessing in themselves, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page400"
       name="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span> and the consumers at
       least are ever benefited by a fall in the cost of grain.
       Cheap prices are a real blessing if that effect consists
       with prosperity to the producer, as by improved methods of
       cultivation or manufacture, or the benignity of nature in
       giving fine seasons. But cheap prices are the greatest of
       all evils, and to none more shall the consumers, if they are
       the result, not of the magnitude of domestic production, but
       of the magnitude of foreign importation. It was that sort of
       cheap prices which ruined the Roman empire, from the
       destruction of the agriculture of Italy; it is that sort of
       cheap prices which has ruined the Indian weavers, from the
       disastrous competition of the British steam-engine; it is
       that sort of low prices which has so grievously depressed
       British shipping, from the disastrous competition of the
       Baltic vessels under the reciprocity system. It is in vain
       for the consumers to say, we will separate our case from
       that of the producers, and care not, so as we get low
       prices, what comes of them. Where will the consumers be, and
       that erelong, if the producers are destroyed? What will be
       the condition of the landlords if their farmers are ruined?
       or of bondholders if their debtors are bankrupt? or of
       railway proprietors if traffic ceases? or of owners of bank
       stock if bills are no longer presented for discount? or of
       the 3 per cents if Government, by the failure of the
       productive industry of the country, is rendered bankrupt?
       The consumers all rest on the producers, and must sink or
       swim with them.</p>

        <p>The Turks, finding their own troops not well adapted to
        the irregular and desperate kind of warfare waged by the
        Uzcoques, and also unable to compete with them in the
        rapidity of their movements, formed a corps expressly for
        the pursuit of the freebooters, which was composed of men
        as wild and desperate as themselves. With these
        <i>Martellossi</i>, as they were called, the Uzcoques had
        frequent and sanguinary conflicts. Minucci says of the
        Martellossi, in his <i>Historia degli Uscochi</i>, that
        they were "Scelerati barbari anco 'ordine de' medesime
        Scochi."</p>

        <p>In Minucci's History of the Uzcoques, continued by Paola
        Sarpi, we find the following:&mdash;"Segna, through its
        position on a cragged rock, was unapproachable by carts or
        horses, and consequently by artillery. The harbour
        appertaining to it, however, was tolerably good, but
        exceedingly difficult of access on account of the north
        wind, (vento di Buora,) which blew almost incessantly in
        the channel leading to it. According to popular belief, the
        Segnarese had the power of causing this wind to blow at
        will, by merely kindling a fire in a certain hollow of the
        cliffs. The mysterious operation of this fire was to heat
        the veins of the earth, which then, through pain or fury,
        sent out the raging hurricanes that rendered those narrow
        seas in the highest degree dangerous, and indeed
        untenable."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
